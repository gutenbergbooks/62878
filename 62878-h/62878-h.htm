<p>Transcriber's Note:</p>

<p>Obvious printer errors have been corrected. Hyphenation has been
rationalised. Inconsistent spelling (including accents and capitals) has
been retained.</p>

The sidenotes to the Empress' Charter in Chapter 4 have been transferred
to "pop ups" that accompany underlined words. These may not display
properly in all applications.

<p>Footnote references in the genealogical tables are not hyper-linked
to the corresponding footnotes. Small capitals in the tables have been
replaced by full capitals. Italics are indicated by _underscores_. The
tables in Appendices K and U have been split into two in order to reduce
their width.</p>

<p>Some references to years are encased in square brackets, as for example
[1136]. To avoid confusion with the numbered footnotes, these references
have instead been encased in rounded brackets.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent">"<span class="smc">The</span> reign of Stephen," in the words of our greatest
living historian, "is one of the most important in our
whole history, as exemplifying the working of causes and
principles which had no other opportunity of exhibiting
their real tendencies." To illustrate in detail the working
of those principles to which the Bishop of Oxford thus
refers, is the chief object I have set before myself in these
pages. For this purpose I have chosen, to form the basis
of my narrative, the career of Geoffrey de Mandeville, as
the most perfect and typical presentment of the feudal
and anarchic spirit that stamps the reign of Stephen. By
fixing our glance upon one man, and by tracing his policy
and its fruits, it is possible to gain a clearer perception of
the true tendencies at work, and to obtain a firmer grasp
of the essential principles involved. But, while availing
myself of Geoffrey's career to give unity to my theme,
I have not scrupled to introduce, from all available sources,
any materials bearing on the period known as the Anarchy,
or illustrating the points raised by the charters with which
I deal.</p>

<p>The headings of my chapters express a fact upon which
I cannot too strongly insist, namely, that the charters
granted to Geoffrey are the very backbone of my work.
By those charters it must stand or fall: for on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">{vi}</a></span>
relation and their evidence the whole narrative is built.
If the evidence of these documents is accepted, and the
relation I have assigned to them established, it will, I trust,
encourage the study of charters and their evidence, "as
enabling the student both to amplify and to check such
scanty knowledge as we now possess of the times to which
they relate."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span>
It will also result in the contribution of
some new facts to English history, and break, as it were,
by the wayside, a few stones towards the road on which
future historians will travel.</p>

<p>Among the subjects on which I shall endeavour to throw
some fresh light are problems of constitutional and institutional
interest, such as the title to the English Crown,
the origin and character of earldoms (especially the earldom
of Arundel), the development of the fiscal system, and the
early administration of London. I would also invite
attention to such points as the appeal of the Empress to
Rome in 1136, her intended coronation at Westminster
in 1141, the unknown Oxford intrigue of 1142, the new
theory on Norman castles suggested by Geoffrey's charters,
and the genealogical discoveries in the Appendix on Gervase
de Cornhill. The prominent part that the Earl of
Gloucester played in the events of which I write may
justify the inclusion of an essay on the creation of his
historic earldom, which has, in the main, already appeared
in another quarter.</p>

<p>In the words of Mr. Eyton, "the dispersion of error is
the first step in the discovery of truth."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
Cordially adopting
this maxim, I have endeavoured throughout to correct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">{vii}</a></span>
errors and dispose of existing misconceptions. To "dare
to be accurate" is, as Mr. Freeman so often reminds us,
neither popular nor pleasant. It is easier to prophesy
smooth things, and to accept without question the errors
of others, in the spirit of mutual admiration. But I would
repeat that "boast as we may of the achievements of our
new scientific school, we are still, as I have urged, behind
the Germans, so far, at least, as accuracy is concerned."
If my criticism be deemed harsh, I may plead with Newman
that, in controversy, "I have ever felt from experience
that no one would believe me to be in earnest if I spoke
calmly." The public is slow to believe that writers who
have gained its ear are themselves often in error and, by
the weight of their authority, lead others astray. At the
same time, I would earnestly insist that if, in the light of
new evidence, I have found myself compelled to differ from
the conclusions even of Dr. Stubbs, it in no way impeaches
the accuracy of that unrivalled scholar, the profundity of
whose learning and the soundness of whose judgment can
only be appreciated by those who have followed him in
the same field.</p>

<p>The ill-health which has so long postponed the completion
and appearance of this work is responsible for
some shortcomings of which no one is more conscious than
myself. It has been necessary to correct the proof-sheets
at a distance from works of reference, and indeed from
England, while the length of time that has elapsed since
the bulk of the work was composed is such that two or
three new books bearing upon the same period have
appeared in the mean while. Of these I would specially
mention Mr. Howlett's contributions to the Rolls Series,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
and Miss Norgate's well-known <i>England under the Angevin
Kings</i>. Mr. Howlett's knowledge of the period, and
especially of its MS. authorities, is of a quite exceptional
character, while Miss Norgate's useful and painstaking
work, which enjoys the advantage of a style that one
cannot hope to rival, is a most welcome addition to our
historical literature. To Dr. Stubbs, also, we are indebted
for a new edition of William of Malmesbury. As I had
employed for that chronicler and for the <i>Gesta Stephani</i>
the English Historical Society's editions, my references
are made to them, except where they are specially assigned
to those editions by Dr. Stubbs and Mr. Howlett which
have since appeared.</p>

<p>A few points of detail should, perhaps, be mentioned.
The text of transcripts has been scrupulously preserved,
even where it seemed corrupt; and all my extensions as to
which any possible question could arise are enclosed in
square brackets. The so-called "new style" has been
adhered to throughout: that is to say, the dates given are
those of the true historical year, irrespective of the wholly
artificial reckoning from March 25. The form "fitz,"
denounced by purists, has been retained as a necessary
convention, the admirable <i>Calendar of Patent Rolls</i>, now
in course of publication, having demonstrated the impossibility
of devising a satisfactory substitute. As to the
spelling of Christian names, no attempt has been made to
produce that pedantic uniformity which, in the twelfth
century, was unknown. It is hoped that the index
may be found serviceable and complete. The allusions
to "the lost volume of the Great Coucher" (of the duchy
of Lancaster) are based on references to that compilation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
by seventeenth-century transcribers, which cannot be
identified in the volumes now preserved. It is to be
feared that the volume most in request among antiquaries
may, in those days, have been "lent out" (cf. p. 183),
with the usual result. I am anxious to call attention to
its existence in the hope of its ultimate recovery.</p>

<p>There remains the pleasant task of tendering my thanks
to Mr. Hubert Hall, of H.M.'s Public Record Office, and
Mr. F. Bickley, of the MS. Department, British Museum,
for their invariable courtesy and assistance in the course
of my researches. To Mr. Douglass Round I am indebted
for several useful suggestions, and for much valuable help
in passing these pages through the press.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
<small>THE ACCESSION OF STEPHEN</small>.</h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Before</span>
approaching that struggle between King Stephen
and his rival, the Empress Maud, with which this work
is mainly concerned, it is desirable to examine the peculiar
conditions of Stephen's accession to the crown, determining,
as they did, his position as king, and supplying,
we shall find, the master-key to the anomalous character
of his reign.</p>

<p>The actual facts of the case are happily beyond
question. From the moment of his uncle's death, as Dr.
Stubbs truly observes, "the succession was treated as an
open question."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span> Stephen, quick to see his chance, made
a bold stroke for the crown. The wind was in his favour,
and, with a handful of comrades, he landed on the shores
of Kent.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span> His first reception was not encouraging: Dover
refused him admission, and Canterbury closed her gates.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
On this Dr. Stubbs thus comments:—</p>

<p class="small">"At Dover and at Canterbury he was received with sullen silence.
The men of Kent had no love for the stranger who came, as his predecessor
Eustace had done, to trouble the land."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
But "the men of Kent" were faithful to Stephen,
when all others forsook him, and, remembering this, one
would hardly expect to find in them his chief opponents.
Nor, indeed, were they. Our great historian, when he
wrote thus, must, I venture to think, have overlooked the
passage in Ordericus (v. 110), from which we learn, incidentally,
that Canterbury and Dover were among those
fortresses which the Earl of Gloucester held by his father's
gift.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span> It is, therefore, not surprising that Stephen should
have met with this reception at the hands of the lieutenants
of his arch-rival. It might, indeed, be thought
that the prescient king had of set purpose placed these
keys of the road to London in the hands of one whom he
could trust to uphold his cherished scheme.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen, undiscouraged by these incidents, pushed on
rapidly to London. The news of his approach had gone
before him, and the citizens flocked to meet him. By
them, as is well known, he was promptly chosen to be king,
on the plea that a king was needed to fill the vacant
throne, and that the right to elect one was specially vested
in themselves.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span> The point, however, that I would here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
insist on, for it seems to have been scarcely noticed, is
that this election appears to have been essentially conditional,
and to have been preceded by an agreement
with the citizens.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span> The bearing of this will be shown
below.</p>

<p>There is another noteworthy point which would seem
to have escaped observation. It is distinctly implied by
William of Malmesbury that the primate, seizing his
opportunity, on Stephen's appearance in London, had
extorted from him, as a preliminary to his recognition,
as Maurice had done from Henry at his coronation, and
as Henry of Winchester was, later, to do in the case of
the Empress, an oath to restore the Church her "liberty,"
a phrase of which the meaning is well known. Stephen,
he adds, on reaching Winchester, was released from this
oath by his brother, who himself "went bail" (made
himself responsible) for Stephen's satisfactory behaviour
to the Church.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_11" id="Ref_11" href="#Foot_11">[11]</a></span> It is, surely, to this incident that Henry
so pointedly alludes in his speech at the election of the
Empress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span> It can only, I think, be explained on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
hypothesis that Stephen chafed beneath the oath he had
taken, and begged his brother to set him free. If so, the
attempt was vain, for he had, we shall find, to bind himself
anew on the occasion of his Oxford charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>At Winchester the citizens, headed by their bishop,
came forth from the city to greet him, but this reception
must not be confused (as it is by Mr. Freeman) with his
election by the citizens of London.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_14" id="Ref_14" href="#Foot_14">[14]</a></span> His brother, needless
to say, met him with an eager welcome, and the main
object of his visit was attained when William de Pont de
l'Arche, who had shrunk, till his arrival, from embracing
his cause, now, in concert with the head of the administration,
Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, placed at his disposal
the royal castle, with the treasury and all that it contained.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus strengthened, he returned to London for coronation
at the hands of the primate. Dr. Stubbs observes
that "he returned to London for <i>formal election</i> and
coronation."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span> His authority for that statement is Gervase
(i. 94), who certainly asserts it distinctly.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span> But it will
be found that he, who was not a contemporary, is the
only authority for this second election, and, moreover,
that he ignores the first, as well as the visit to Winchester,
thus mixing up the two episodes, between which that visit
intervened. Of course this opens the wider question as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
whether the actual election, in such cases, took place at
the coronation itself or on a previous occasion. This
may, perhaps, be a matter of opinion; but in the preceding
instance, that of Henry I., the election was admittedly
that which took place at Winchester, and was previous to
and unconnected with the actual coronation itself.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span> From
this point of view, the presentation of the king to the
people at his coronation would assume the aspect of a
ratification of the election previously conducted. The
point is here chiefly of importance as affecting the validity
of Stephen's election. If his only election was that which
the citizens of London conducted, it was, to say the least,
"informally transacted."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span> Nor was the attendance of
magnates at the ceremony such as to improve its character.
It was, as Dr. Stubbs truly says, "but a poor substitute
for the great councils which had attended the summons of
William and Henry."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span> The chroniclers are here unsatisfactory.
Henry of Huntingdon is rhetorical and vague;
John of Hexham leaves us little wiser;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span> the Continuator of
Florence indeed states that Stephen, when crowned, kept
his Christmas court "cum totius Angliæ primoribus"
(p. 95), but even the author of the <i>Gesta</i> implies that the
primate's scruples were largely due to the paucity of
magnates present.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span> William of Malmesbury alone is
precise,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span> possibly because an adversary of Stephen could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
alone afford to be so, and his testimony, we shall find, is
singularly confirmed by independent charter evidence (p. 11).</p>

<p>It was at this stage that an attempt was made to dispel
the scruples caused by Stephen's breach of his oath to the
late king. The hint, in the <i>Gesta</i>, that Henry, on his
deathbed, had repented of his act in extorting that oath,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span>
is amplified by Gervase into a story that he had released
his barons from its bond,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span> while Ralph "de Diceto" represents
the assertion as nothing less than that the late king
had actually disinherited the Empress, and made Stephen
his heir in her stead.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span> It should be noticed that these last
two writers, in their statement that this story was proved
by Hugh Bigod on oath, are confirmed by the independent
evidence of the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>The importance of securing, as quickly as possible,
the performance of the ceremony of coronation is well
brought out by the author of the <i>Gesta</i> in the arguments
of Stephen's friends when combating the primate's
scruples. They urged that it would <i>ipso facto</i> put an end
to all question as to the validity of his election.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span> The
advantage, in short, of "snatching" a coronation was
that, in the language of modern diplomacy, of securing a
<i>fait accompli</i>. Election was a matter of opinion; coronation
a matter of fact. Or, to employ another expression,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
it was the "outward and visible sign" that a king
had begun his reign. Its important bearing is well seen
in the case of the Conqueror himself. Dr. Stubbs observes,
with his usual judgment, that "the ceremony was understood
as bestowing the divine ratification on the election
that had preceded it."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span> Now, the fact that the performance
of this essential ceremony was, of course, wholly in the
hands of the Church, in whose power, therefore, it always
was to perform or to withhold it at its pleasure, appears
to me to have naturally led to the growing assumption
that we now meet with, the claim, based on a confusion
of the ceremony with the actual election itself, that it
was for the Church to elect the king. This claim, which
in the case of Stephen (1136) seems to have been only
inchoate,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span> appears at the time of his capture (1141) in a
fully developed form,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span> the circumstances of the time
having enabled the Church to increase its power in the
State with perhaps unexampled rapidity.</p>

<p>May it not have been this development, together with
his own experience, that led Stephen to press for the
coronation of his son Eustace in his lifetime (1152)? In
this attempted innovation he was, indeed, defeated by the
Church, but the lesson was not lost. Henry I., unlike his
contemporaries, had never taken this precaution, and
Henry II., warned by his example, succeeded in obtaining
the coronation of his heir (1170) in the teeth of Becket's
endeavours to forbid the act, and so to uphold the veto of
the Church.</p>

<p>Prevailed upon, at length, to perform the ceremony,
the primate seized the opportunity of extorting from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
eager king (besides a charter of liberties) a renewal of his
former oath to protect the rights of the Church. The oath
which Henry had sworn at his coronation, and which
Maud had to swear at her election, Stephen had to swear,
it seems, at both, though not till the Oxford charter was
it committed, in his case, to writing.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>We now approach an episode unknown to all our
historians.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The Empress, on her side, had not been idle; she had
despatched an envoy to the papal court, in the person of
the Bishop of Angers, to appeal her rival of (1) defrauding
her of her right, and (2) breach of his solemn oath. Had
this been known to Mr. Freeman, he would, it is safe
to assert, have been fascinated by the really singular
coincidence between the circumstances of 1136 and of
1066. In each case, of the rivals for the throne, the one
based his pretensions on (1) kinship, fortified by (2) an
oath to secure his succession, which had been taken by
his opponent himself; while the other rested his claims on
election duly followed by coronation. In each case the
election was fairly open to question; in Harold's, because
(<i>pace</i> Mr. Freeman) he was <i>not</i> a legitimate candidate; in
Stephen's, because, though a qualified candidate, his
election had been most informal. In each case the ousted
claimant appealed to the papal court, and, in each case,
on the same grounds, viz. (1) the kinship, (2) the broken
oath. In each case the successful party was opposed by a
particular cardinal, a fact which we learn, in each case,
from later and incidental mention. And in each case that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
cardinal became, afterwards, pope. But here the parallel
ends. Stephen accepted, where Harold had (so far as we
know) rejected, the jurisdiction of the Court of Rome.
We may assign this difference to the closer connection
between Rome and England in Stephen's day, or we may
see in it proof that Stephen was the more politic of the
two. For his action was justified by its success. There
has been, on this point, no small misconception. Harold
has been praised for possessing, and Stephen blamed for
lacking, a sense of his kingly dignity. But <i>læsio fidei</i> was
essentially a matter for courts Christian, and thus for the
highest of them all, at Rome. Again, inheritance, so far
as inheritance affected the question, was brought in many
ways within the purview of the courts Christian, as, for
instance, in the case of the alleged illegitimacy of Maud.
Moreover, in 1136, the pope, though circumstances played
into his hands, advanced no such pretension as his successor
in the days of John. His attitude was not that of
an overlord to a dependent fief: he made no claim to
dispose of the realm of England. Sitting as judge in a
spiritual court, he listened to the charges brought by
Maud against Stephen in his personal capacity, and, without
formally acquitting him, declined to pronounce him
guilty.</p>

<p>Though the king was pleased to describe the papal
letter which followed as a "confirmation" of his right to
the throne, it was, strictly, nothing of the kind. It was
simply, in the language of modern diplomacy, his "recognition"
by the pope as king. If Ferdinand, elected Prince
of Bulgaria, were to be recognized as such by a foreign
power, that action would neither alter his status relatively
to any other power, nor would it imply the least claim to
dispose of the Bulgarian crown. Or, again, to take a
mediæval illustration, the recognition as pope by an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
English king of one of two rival claimants for the papacy
would neither affect any other king, nor constitute a claim
to dispose of the papal tiara. Stephen, however, was
naturally eager to make the most of the papal action,
especially when he found in his oath to the Empress the
most formidable obstacle to his acceptance. The sanction
of the Church would silence the reproach that he was
occupying the throne as a perjured man. Hence the
clause in his Oxford charter. To the advantage which
this letter gave him Stephen shrewdly clung, and when
Geoffrey summoned him, in later years, "to an investigation
of his claims before the papal court," he promptly retorted
that Rome had already heard the case.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span> He turned, in
fact, the tables on his appellant by calling on Geoffrey to
justify his occupation of the Duchy and of the Western
counties in the teeth of the papal confirmation of his
own right to the throne.</p>

<p>We now pass from Westminster to Reading, whither,
after Christmas, Stephen proceeded, to attend his uncle's
funeral.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span> The corpse, says the Continuator, was attended
"non modica stipatus nobilium catervâ." The meeting
of Stephen with these nobles is an episode of considerable
importance. "It is probable," says Dr. Stubbs,
"that it furnished an opportunity of obtaining some vague
promises from Stephen."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span> But the learned writer here
alludes to the subsequent promises at Oxford. What I
am concerned with is the meeting at Reading. I proceed,
therefore, to quote <i>in extenso</i> a charter which must have
passed on this occasion, and which, this being so, is of
great value and interest.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The reflections suggested by this charter are many and
most instructive. Firstly, we have here the most emphatic
corroboration of the evidence of William of Malmesbury.
The four first witnesses comprise the three bishops who,
according to him, conducted Stephen's coronation, together
with the notorious Hugh Bigod, to whose timely assurance
that coronation was so largely due. The four others are
Robert fitz Richard, whom we shall find present at the
Easter court, attesting a charter as a royal chamberlain;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
Enguerrand de Sai, the lord of Clun, who had probably
come with Payne fitz John; William de Pont de l'Arche,
whom we met at Winchester; and Payne fitz John. The
impression conveyed by this charter is certainly that
Stephen had as yet been joined by few of the magnates,
and had still to be content with the handful by whom his
coronation had been attended.</p>

<p>An important addition is, however, represented by the
grantee, Miles of Gloucester, and the witness Payne fitz
John. The former was a man of great power, both of
himself and from his connection with the Earl of Gloucester,
in the west of England and in Wales. The latter is represented
by the author of the <i>Gesta</i> as acting with him at this
juncture.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span> It should, however, be noted, as important in
its bearing on the chronology of this able writer, that
he places the adhesion of these two barons (p. 15) considerably
after that of the Earl of Gloucester (p. 8), whereas
the case was precisely the contrary, the earl not submitting
to Stephen till some time later on. Both these magnates
appear in attendance at Stephen's Easter court (<i>vide infra</i>),
and again as witnesses to his Oxford charter. The part,
however, in the coming struggle which Miles of Gloucester
was destined to play, was such that it is most important
to learn the circumstances and the date of his adhesion
to the king. His companion, Payne fitz John, was slain,
fighting the Welsh, in the spring of the following year.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
It is a singular fact that, in addition to the charter I
have here given, another charter was granted to Miles
of Gloucester by the king, which, being similarly tested at
Reading, probably passed on this occasion. The subject
of the grant is the same, but the terms are more precise,
the constableship of Gloucester Castle, with the hereditary
estates of his house, being specially mentioned.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span> Though
both these charters were entered in the Great Coucher (in
the volume now missing), the latter alone is referred to by
Dugdale, from whose transcript it has been printed by
Madox.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span> Though the names of the witnesses are there
omitted, those of the six leading witnesses are supplied
by an abstract which is elsewhere found. Three of
these are among those who attest the other charter—Robert
fitz Richard, Hugh Bigod, and Enguerrand de
Sai; but the other three names are new, being Robert de
Ferrers, afterwards Earl of Derby, Baldwin de Clare, the
spokesman of Stephen's host at Lincoln (see p. 148), and
(Walter) fitz Richard, who afterwards appears in attendance
at the Easter court.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span> These three barons should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
therefore be added to the list of those who were at Reading
with the king.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>Possibly, however, the most instructive feature to be
found in each charter is the striking illustration it affords
of the method by which Stephen procured the adhesion
of the turbulent and ambitious magnates. It is not so
much a grant from a king to a subject as a <i>convencio</i> between
equal powers. But especially would I invite attention to
the words "ut dominus et Rex."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_44" id="Ref_44" href="#Foot_44">[44]</a></span> I see in them at once the
symbol and the outcome of "the Norman idea of royalty."
In his learned and masterly analysis of this subject, a
passage which cannot be too closely studied, Dr. Stubbs
shows us, with felicitous clearness, the twin factors of
Norman kinghood, its royal and its feudal aspects.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_45" id="Ref_45" href="#Foot_45">[45]</a></span> Surely
in the expression "dominus et Rex" (<i>alias</i> "Rex et
dominus") we have in actual words the exponent of this
double character.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_46" id="Ref_46" href="#Foot_46">[46]</a></span> And, more than this, we have here
the needful and striking parallel which will illustrate and
illumine the action of the Empress, so strangely overlooked
or misunderstood, when she ordered herself, at Winchester,
to be proclaimed "<span class="smc">Domina et Regina</span>."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
Henry of Huntingdon asserts distinctly that from
Reading Stephen passed to Oxford, and that he there
renewed the pledges he had made on his coronation-day.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_47" id="Ref_47" href="#Foot_47">[47]</a></span>
That, on leaving Reading, he moved to Oxford, though the
fact is mentioned by no other chronicler, would seem to be
placed beyond question by Henry's repeated assertion.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_48" id="Ref_48" href="#Foot_48">[48]</a></span>
But the difficulty is that Henry specifies what these pledges
were, and that the version he gives cannot be reconciled
either with the king's "coronation charter" or with what is
known as his "second charter," granted at Oxford later in
the year. Dr. Stubbs, with the caution of a true scholar,
though he thinks it "probable," in his great work, that
Stephen, upon this occasion, made "some vague promises,"
yet adds, of those recorded by Henry—</p>

<p class="small">"Whether these promises were embodied in a charter is uncertain:
if they were, the charter is lost; it is, however, more probable that the
story is a popular version of the document which was actually issued
by the king, at Oxford, later in the year 1136."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_49" id="Ref_49" href="#Foot_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>In his later work he seems inclined to place more
credence in Henry's story.</p>

<p class="small">"After the funeral, at Oxford or somewhere in the neighbourhood,
he arranged terms with them; terms by which he endeavoured,
amplifying the words of his charter, to catch the good will of each
class of his subjects.... The promises were, perhaps, not insincere at
the time; anyhow, they had the desired effect, and united the nation
for the moment."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_50" id="Ref_50" href="#Foot_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be seen that the point is a most perplexing one,
and can scarcely at present be settled with certainty. But
there is one point beyond dispute, namely, that the so-called
"second charter" was issued later in the year,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
after the king's return from the north. Mr. Freeman,
therefore, has not merely failed to grasp the question at
issue, but has also strangely contradicted himself when he
confidently assigns this "second charter" to the king's
first visit to Oxford, and refers us, in doing so, to another
page, in which it is as unhesitatingly assigned to his other
and later visit after his return from the north.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_51" id="Ref_51" href="#Foot_51">[51]</a></span> If I call
attention to this error, it is because I venture to think
it one to which this writer is too often liable, and
against which, therefore, his readers should be placed
upon their guard.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_52" id="Ref_52" href="#Foot_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at Oxford, in January,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_53" id="Ref_53" href="#Foot_53">[53]</a></span> that Stephen heard of
David's advance into England. With creditable rapidity
he assembled an army and hastened to the north to meet
him. He encountered him at Durham on the 5th of
February (the day after Ash Wednesday), and effected a
peaceable agreement. He then retraced his steps, after a
stay of about a fortnight,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_54" id="Ref_54" href="#Foot_54">[54]</a></span> and returned to keep his Easter
(March 22) at Westminster. I wish to invite special
attention to this Easter court, because it was in many
ways of great importance, although historians have almost
ignored its existence. Combining the evidence of charters
with that which the chroniclers afford, we can learn not a
little about it, and see how notable an event it must have
seemed at the time it was held. We should observe, in
the first place, that this was no mere "curia de more":
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
it was emphatically a great or national council. The
author of the <i>Gesta</i> describes it thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Omnibus igitur summatibus regni, fide et jurejurando cum rege
constrictis, edicto per Angliam promulgato, summos ecclesiarum ductores
cum primis populi ad concilium Londonias conscivit. Illis quoque
quasi in unam sentinam illuc confluentibus ecclesiarumque columnis
sedendi ordine dispositis, vulgo etiam confuse et permixtim,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_55" id="Ref_55" href="#Foot_55">[55]</a></span> ut solet,
ubique se ingerente, plura regno et ecclesiæ profutura fuerunt et
utiliter ostensa et salubriter pertractata."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_56" id="Ref_56" href="#Foot_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>We have clearly in this great council, held on the
first court day (Easter) after the king's coronation, a revival
of the splendours of former reigns, so sorely dimmed
beneath the rule of his bereaved and parsimonious uncle.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_57" id="Ref_57" href="#Foot_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon has a glowing description of this
Easter court,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_58" id="Ref_58" href="#Foot_58">[58]</a></span> which reminds one of William of Malmesbury's
pictures of the Conqueror in his glory.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_59" id="Ref_59" href="#Foot_59">[59]</a></span> When,
therefore, Dr. Stubbs tells us that this custom of the
Conqueror "was restored by Henry II." (<i>Const. Hist.</i>,
i. 370), he ignores this brilliant revival at the outset of
Stephen's reign. Stephen, coming into possession of his
predecessor's hoarded treasure, was as eager to plunge into
costly pomp as was Henry VIII. on the death of his mean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
and grasping sire. There were also more solid reasons
for this dazzling assembly. It was desirable for the king
to show himself to his new subjects in his capital, surrounded
not only by the evidence of wealth, but by that
of his national acceptance. The presence at his court
of the magnates from all parts of the realm was a fact
which would speak for itself, and to secure which he had
clearly resolved that no pains should be spared.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_60" id="Ref_60" href="#Foot_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>If the small group who attended his coronation had
indeed been "but a poor substitute for the great councils
which had attended the summons of William and Henry,"
he was resolved that this should be forgotten in the
splendour of his Easter court.</p>

<p>This view is strikingly confirmed by the lists of witnesses
to two charters which must have passed on this
occasion. The one is a grant to the see of Winchester
of the manor of Sutton, in Hampshire, in exchange for
Morden, in Surrey. The other is a grant of the bishopric
of Bath to Robert of Lewes. The former is dated
"Apud Westmonasterium in presentia et audientia subscriptorum
anno incarnationis dominicæ, 1136," etc.;
the latter, "Apud Westmonasterium in generalis concilii
celebratione et Paschalis festi solemnitate." At first
sight, I confess, both charters have a rather spurious
appearance. Their stilted style awakes suspicion, which
is not lessened by the dating clauses or the extraordinary
number of witnesses. Coming, however, from independent
sources, and dealing with two unconnected subjects, they
mutually confirm one another. We have, moreover, still
extant the charter by which Henry II. confirmed the
former of the two, and as this is among the duchy of
Lancaster records, we have every reason to believe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
the original charter itself was, as both its transcribers
assert, among them also. Again, as to the lists of witnesses.
Abnormally long though these may seem, we
must remember that in the charters of Henry I., especially
towards the close of his reign, there was a tendency to
increase the number of witnesses. Moreover, in the Oxford
charter, by which these were immediately followed,
we have a long list of witnesses (thirty-seven), and, which
is noteworthy, it is similarly arranged on a principle of
classification, the court officers being grouped together.
I have, therefore, given in an appendix, for the purpose of
comparison, all three lists.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_61" id="Ref_61" href="#Foot_61">[61]</a></span> If we analyze those appended
to the two London charters, we find their authenticity
confirmed by the fact that, while the Earl of Gloucester,
who was abroad at the time, is conspicuously absent
from the list, Henry, son of the King of Scots, duly
appears among the attesting earls, and we are specially
told by John of Hexham that he was present at this
Easter court.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_62" id="Ref_62" href="#Foot_62">[62]</a></span> Miles of Gloucester and Brian fitz Count
also figure together among the witnesses—a fact, from
their position, of some importance.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_63" id="Ref_63" href="#Foot_63">[63]</a></span> It is, too, of interest
for our purpose, to note that among them is Geoffrey de
Mandeville. The extraordinary number of witnesses to
these charters (no less than fifty-five in one case, excluding
the king and queen, and thirty-six in the other) is not
only of great value as giving us the <i>personnel</i> of this
brilliant court, but is also, when compared with the Oxford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
charter, suggestive perhaps of a desire, by the king,
to place on record the names of those whom he had induced
to attend his courts and so to recognize his claims.
Mr. Pym Yeatman more than once, in his strange <i>History
of the House of Arundel</i>, quotes the charter to Winchester
as from a transcript "among the valuable collection of
MSS. belonging to the Earl of Egmont" (p. 49). It may,
therefore, be of benefit to students to remind them that
it is printed in Hearne's <i>Liber Niger</i> (ii. 808, 809).
Mr. Yeatman, moreover, observes of this charter—</p>

<p class="small">"It contains the names of no less than thirty-four noblemen of the
highest rank (excluding only the Earl of Gloucester), but not a single
ecclesiastical witness attests the grant, which is perhaps not remarkable,
since it was a dangerous precedent to deal in such a matter with
Church property, perhaps a new precedent created by Stephen" (p. 286).</p>

<p>To other students it will appear "perhaps not remarkable"
that the charter is witnessed by the unusual
number of no less than three archbishops and thirteen
bishops.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_64" id="Ref_64" href="#Foot_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, although this was a national council, the state
and position of the Church was the chief subject of
discussion. The author of the <i>Gesta</i>, who appears to have
been well informed on the subject, shows us the prelates
appealing to Stephen to relieve the Church from the
intolerable oppression which she had suffered, under the
form of law, at the hands of Henry I. Stephen, bland,
for the time, to all, and more especially to the powerful
Church, listened graciously to their prayers, and promised
all they asked.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_65" id="Ref_65" href="#Foot_65">[65]</a></span> In the grimly jocose language of the day,
the keys of the Church, which had been held by Simon
(Magus), were henceforth to be restored to Peter. To this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
I trace a distinct allusion in the curious phrase which
meets us in the Bath charter. Stephen grants the
bishopric of Bath "<i>canonica prius electione præcedente</i>."
This recognition of the Church's right, with the public
record of the fact, confirms the account of his attitude on
this occasion to the Church. The whole charter contrasts
strangely with that by which, fifteen years before, his
predecessor had granted the bishopric of Hereford, and its
reference to the counsel and consent of the magnates
betrays the weakness of his position.</p>

<p>This council took place, as I have said, at London and
during Easter. But there is some confusion on the subject.
Mr. Howlett, in his excellent edition of the <i>Gesta</i>, assigns
it, in footnotes (pp. 17, 18), to "early in April." But
his argument that, as that must have been (as it was) the
date of the (Oxford) charter, it was consequently that of
the (London) council, confuses two distinct events. In
this he does but follow the <i>Gesta</i>, which similarly runs into
one the two consecutive events. Richard of Hexham
also, followed by John of Hexham,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_66" id="Ref_66" href="#Foot_66">[66]</a></span> combines in one the
council at London with the charter issued at Oxford, besides
placing them both, wrongly, far too late in the year.</p>

The point to keep clearly in mind is that the Earl of
Gloucester was not present at the Easter court in London,
and that, landing subsequently, he was present when the
charter of liberties was granted at Oxford. So short an
interval of time elapsed that there cannot have been two
councils. There was, I believe, one council which adjourned
from London to Oxford, and which did so on
purpose to meet the virtual head of the opposition, the
powerful Earl of Gloucester. It must have been the
waiting for his arrival at court which postponed the issue
of the charter, and it is not wonderful that, under these
circumstances, the chroniclers should have made of the
whole but one transaction.</p>

<p>The earl, on his arrival, did homage, with the very
important and significant reservation that his loyalty
would be strictly conditional on Stephen's behaviour to
himself.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_67" id="Ref_67" href="#Foot_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>His example in this respect was followed by the
bishops, for we read in the chronicler, immediately afterwards:</p>

<p class="small">"Eodem anno, non multo post adventum comitis, juraverunt episcopi
fidelitatem regi quamdiu ille libertatem ecclesiæ et vigorem
disciplinæ conservaret."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_68" id="Ref_68" href="#Foot_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">By this writer the incident in question is recorded in connection
with the Oxford charter. In this he must be
correct, if it was subsequent to the earl's homage, for this
latter itself, we see, must have been subsequent to Easter.</p>

<p>Probably the council at London was the preliminary
to that treaty (<i>convencio</i>) between the king and the
bishops, at which William of Malmesbury so plainly hints,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
and of which the Oxford charter is virtually the exponent
record. For this, I take it, is the point to be steadily
kept in view, namely, that the terms of such a charter as
this are the resultant of two opposing forces—the one, the
desire to extort from the king the utmost possible concession;
the other, his desire to extort homage at the lowest
price he could. Taken in connection with the presence at
Oxford of his arch-opponent, the Earl of Gloucester, this
view, I would venture to urge, may lead us to the conclusion
that this extended version of his meagre "coronation
charter" represents his final and definite acceptance, by
the magnates of England, as their king.</p>

<p>It may be noticed, incidentally, as illustrative of the
chronicle-value of charters, that not a single chronicler
records this eventful assembly at Oxford. Our knowledge
of it is derived wholly and solely from the testing clause
of the charter itself—"Apud Oxeneford, anno ab incarnatione
Domini <small>MCXXXVI</small>." Attention should also, perhaps,
be drawn to this repeated visit to Oxford, and to
the selection of that spot for this assembly. For this its
central position may, doubtless, partly account, especially
if the Earl of Gloucester was loth to come further east.
But it also, we must remember, represented for Stephen,
as it were, a post of observation, commanding, in Bristol
and Gloucester, the two strongholds of the opposition.
So, conversely, it represented to the Empress an advanced
post resting on their base.</p>

<p>Lastly, I think it perfectly possible to fix pretty closely
the date of this assembly and charter. Easter falling
on the 22nd of March, neither the king nor the Earl of
Gloucester would have reached Oxford till the end of March
or, perhaps, the beginning of April. But as early as
Rogation-tide (April 26-29) it was rumoured that the king
was dead, and Hugh Bigod, who, as a royal <i>dapifer</i>, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
been among the witnesses to this Oxford charter, burst
into revolt at once.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_69" id="Ref_69" href="#Foot_69">[69]</a></span> Then followed the suppression of the
rebellion, and the king's breach of the charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_70" id="Ref_70" href="#Foot_70">[70]</a></span> It would
seem, therefore, to be beyond question that this assembly
took place early in April (1136).</p>

<p>I have gone thus closely into these details in order to
bring out as clearly as possible the process, culminating
in the Oxford charter, by which the succession of Stephen
was gradually and, above all, conditionally secured.</p>

<p>Stephen, as a king, was an admitted failure. I cannot,
however, but view with suspicion the causes assigned to
his failure by often unfriendly chroniclers. That their
criticisms had some foundation it would not be possible
to deny. But in the first place, had he enjoyed better
fortune, we should have heard less of his incapacity, and
in the second, these writers, not enjoying the same standpoint
as ourselves, were, I think, somewhat inclined to
mistake effects for causes. Stephen, for instance, has
been severely blamed, mainly on the authority of Henry
of Huntingdon,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_71" id="Ref_71" href="#Foot_71">[71]</a></span> for not punishing more severely the rebels
who held Exeter against him in 1136. Surely, in doing
so, his critics must forget the parallel cases of both his
predecessors. William Rufus at the siege of Rochester
(1088), Henry I. at the siege of Bridgnorth (1102), should
both be remembered when dealing with Stephen at the
siege of Exeter. In both these cases, the people had
clamoured for condign punishment on the traitors; in
both, the king, who had conquered by their help, was held
back by the jealousy of his barons, from punishing their
fellows as they deserved. We learn from the author of
the <i>Gesta</i> that the same was the case at Exeter. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
king's barons again intervened to save those who had
rebelled from ruin, and at the same time to prevent the
king from securing too signal a triumph.</p>

<p>This brings us to the true source of his weakness
throughout his reign. That weakness was due to two
causes, each supplementing the other. These were—(1) the
essentially unsatisfactory character of his position, as
resting, virtually, on a compact that he should be king so
long only as he gave satisfaction to those who had placed
him on the throne; (2) the existence of a rival claim,
hanging over him from the first, like the sword of Damocles,
and affording a lever by which the malcontents could
compel him to adhere to the original understanding, or
even to submit to further demands.</p>

<p>Let us glance at them both in succession.</p>

<p>Stephen himself describes his title in the opening clause
of his Oxford charter:—</p>

<p class="small">"Ego Stephanus Dei gratia assensu cleri et populi in regem Anglorum
electus, et a Willelmo Cantuariensi archiepiscopo et sanctæ
Romanæ ecclesiæ legato consecra tus, et ab Innocentio sanctæ Romanæ
sedis pontifice confirmatus."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_72" id="Ref_72" href="#Foot_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>On this clause Dr. Stubbs observes:—</p>

<p class="small">"His rehearsal of his title is curious and important; it is worth
while to compare it with that of Henry I., but it need not necessarily
be interpreted as showing a consciousness of weakness."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_73" id="Ref_73" href="#Foot_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Referring to the charter of Henry I., we find the clause
phrased thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"<span class="smc">Henricus filius Willelmi Regis</span>
post obitum fratris sui Willelmi,
Dei gratia rex Anglorum."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_74" id="Ref_74" href="#Foot_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Surely the point to strike us here is that the clause
in Stephen's charter contains just that which is omitted in
Henry's, and omits just that which is contained in Henry's.
Henry puts forward his relationship to his father and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
brother as the sole explanation of his position as king.
Stephen omits all mention of his relationship. Conversely,
the election, etc., set forth by Stephen, finds no place in
the charter of Henry. What can be more significant than
this contrast? Again, the formula in Stephen's charter
should be compared not only with that of Henry, but with
that of his daughter the Empress. As the father had
styled himself "Henricus filius Willelmi Regis," so his
daughter invariably styled herself "Matildis ... Henrici
regis [<i>or</i> regis Henrici] filia;" and so her son, in his time,
is styled (1142), as we shall find in a charter quoted in
this work, "Henricus filius filiæ regis Henrici." To the
importance of this fact I shall recur below. Meanwhile,
the point to bear in mind is, that Stephen's style contains
no allusion to his parentage, though, strangely enough, in
a charter which must have passed in the first year of his
reign, he does adopt the curious style of "Ego Stephanus
Willelmi Anglorum primi Regis nepos," etc.,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_75" id="Ref_75" href="#Foot_75">[75]</a></span> in which
he hints, contrary to his practice, at a quasi-hereditary
right.</p>

<p>Returning, however, to his Oxford charter, in which he
did not venture to allude to such claim, we find him
appealing (<i>a</i>) to his election, which, as we have seen, was
informal enough; (<i>b</i>) to his anointing by the primate;
(<i>c</i>) to his "confirmation" by the pope. It is impossible
to read such a formula as this in any other light than that
of an attempt to "make up a title" under difficulties. I
do not know that it has ever been suggested, though the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
hypothesis would seem highly probable, that the stress
laid by Stephen upon the ecclesiastical sanction to his
succession may have been largely due, as I have said
(p. 10), to the obstacle presented by the oath that had
been sworn to the Empress. Of breaking that oath the
Church, he held, had pronounced him not guilty.</p>

<p>Yet it is not so much on this significant style, as on the
drift of the charter itself, that I depend for support of my
thesis that Stephen was virtually king on sufferance, or, to
anticipate a phrase of later times, "Quamdiu se bene
gesserit." We have seen how in the four typical cases, (1)
of the Londoners, (2) of Miles of Gloucester, (3) of Earl
Robert, (4) of the bishops, Stephen had only secured their
allegiance by submitting to that "original contract" which
the political philosophers of a later age evolved from their
inner consciousness. It was because his Oxford charter set
the seal to this "contract" that Stephen, even then, chafed
beneath its yoke, as evidenced by the striking saving
clause—</p>

<p class="small">"Hæc omnia concedo et confirmo salva regia et justa dignitate
meâ."<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p class="nodent">And, as we know, at the first opportunity, he hastened to
break its bonds.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_77" id="Ref_77" href="#Foot_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>The position of his opponents throughout his reign
would seem to have rested on two assumptions. The first,
that a breach, on his part, of the "contract" justified
<i>ipso facto</i> revolt on theirs;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_78" id="Ref_78" href="#Foot_78">[78]</a></span> the second, that their allegiance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
to the king was a purely feudal relation, and, as
such, could be thrown off at any moment by performing
the famous <i>diffidatio</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_79" id="Ref_79" href="#Foot_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>This essential feature of continental feudalism had
been rigidly excluded by the Conqueror. He had taken
advantage, as is well known, of his position as an English
king, to extort an allegiance from his Norman followers
more absolute than he could have claimed as their feudal
lord. It was to Stephen's peculiar position that was due
the introduction for a time of this pernicious principle
into England. We have seen it hinted at in that charter
of Stephen in which he treats with Miles of Gloucester
not merely as his king (<i>rex</i>), but also as his feudal lord
(<i>dominus</i>). We shall find it acted on three years later
(1139), when this same Miles, with his own <i>dominus</i>,
the Earl of Gloucester, jointly "defy" Stephen before
declaring for the Empress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_80" id="Ref_80" href="#Foot_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing now to the other point, the existence of a rival
claim, we approach a subject of great interest, the theory
of the succession to the English Crown at what may be
termed the crisis of transition from the principle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
election (within the royal house) to that of hereditary
right according to feudal rules.</p>

<p>For the right view on this subject, we turn, as ever,
to Dr. Stubbs, who, with his usual sound judgment, writes
thus of the Norman period:—</p>

<p class="small">"The crown then continued to be elective.... But whilst the
elective principle was maintained in its fulness where it was necessary
or possible to maintain it, it is quite certain that the right of inheritance,
and inheritance as primogeniture, was recognized as co-ordinate....
The measures taken by Henry I. for securing the crown to his
own children, whilst they prove the acceptance of the hereditary
principle, prove also the importance of strengthening it by the recognition
of the elective theory.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_81" id="Ref_81" href="#Foot_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Freeman, though writing with a strong bias in
favour of the elective theory, is fully justified in his main
argument, namely, that Stephen "was no usurper in the
sense in which the word is vulgarly used."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_82" id="Ref_82" href="#Foot_82">[82]</a></span> He urges,
apparently with perfect truth, that Stephen's offence,
in the eyes of his contemporaries, lay in his breaking his
solemn oath, and not in his supplanting a rightful heir.
And he aptly suggests that the wretchedness of his reign
may have hastened the growth of that new belief in the
divine right of the heir to the throne, which first appears
under Henry II., and in the pages of William of
Newburgh.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_83" id="Ref_83" href="#Foot_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>So far as Stephen is concerned the case is clear
enough. But we have also to consider the Empress. On
what did she base her claim? I think that, as implied in
Dr. Stubbs' words, she based it on a double, not a single,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
ground. She claimed the kingdom as King Henry's
daughter ("regis Henrici filia"), but she claimed it
further because the succession had been assured to her
by oath ("sibi juratum") as such.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_84" id="Ref_84" href="#Foot_84">[84]</a></span> It is important to
observe that the oath in question can in no way be
regarded in the light of an election. To understand it
aright, we must go back to the precisely similar oath
which had been previously sworn to her brother. As
early as 1116, the king, in evident anxiety to secure the
succession to his heir, had called upon a gathering of
the magnates "of all England," on the historic spot of
Salisbury, to swear allegiance to his son (March 19).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_85" id="Ref_85" href="#Foot_85">[85]</a></span>
It was with reference to this event that Eadmer described
him at his death (November, 1120) as "Willelmum jam
olim regni hæredem designatum" (p. 290). Before leaving
Normandy in November, 1120, the king similarly secured
the succession of the duchy to his son by compelling its
barons to swear that they would be faithful to the youth.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_86" id="Ref_86" href="#Foot_86">[86]</a></span>
On the destruction of his plans by his son's death, he
hastened to marry again in the hope of securing, once
more, a male heir. Despairing of this after some years,
he took advantage of the Emperor's death to insist on his
daughter's return, and brought her with him to England
in the autumn of 1126. He was not long in taking steps
to secure her recognition as his heir (subject however,
as the Continuator and Symeon are both careful to point
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
out, to no son being born to him), by the same oath being
sworn to her as, in 1116, had been sworn to his son.
It was taken, not (as is always stated) in 1126, but on
the 1st of January, 1127.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_87" id="Ref_87" href="#Foot_87">[87]</a></span> Of what took place upon that
occasion, there is, happily, full evidence.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_88" id="Ref_88" href="#Foot_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>We have independent reports of the transaction from
William of Malmesbury, Symeon of Durham, the Continuator
of Florence, and Gervase of Canterbury.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_89" id="Ref_89" href="#Foot_89">[89]</a></span> From
this last we learn (the fact is, therefore, doubtful) that
the oath secured the succession, not only to the Empress,
but to her heirs.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_90" id="Ref_90" href="#Foot_90">[90]</a></span> The Continuator's version is chiefly
important as bringing out the action of the king in
assigning the succession to his daughter, the oath being
merely an undertaking to secure the arrangement he had
made.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_91" id="Ref_91" href="#Foot_91">[91]</a></span> Symeon introduces the striking expression that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
the Empress was to succeed "hæreditario jure,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_92" id="Ref_92" href="#Foot_92">[92]</a></span> but
William of Malmesbury, in the speech which he places
in the king's mouth, far outstrips this in his assertion
of hereditary right:—</p>

<p class="small">"præfatus quanto incommodo patriæ fortuna Willelmum filium
suum sibi surripuisset, <i>cui jure regnum competeret</i>: nunc superesse
filiam, <i>cui soli legitima debeatur successio, ab avo, avunculo, et patre
regibus</i>; a materno genere multis retro seculis."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_93" id="Ref_93" href="#Foot_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Bearing in mind the time at which William wrote
these words, it will be seen that the Empress and her
partisans must have largely, to say the least, based their
claim on her right to the throne as her father's heir, and
that she and they appealed to the oath as the admission
and recognition of that right, rather than as partaking in
any way whatever of the character of a free election.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_94" id="Ref_94" href="#Foot_94">[94]</a></span>
Thus her claim was neatly traversed by Stephen's advocates,
at Rome, in 1136, when they urged that she was
not her father's heir, and that, consequently, the oath
which had been sworn to her as such ("sicut hæredi")
was void.</p>

<p>It is, as I have said, in the above light that I view her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
unvarying use of the style "regis Henrici filia," and that
this was the true character of her claim will be seen from
the terms of a charter I shall quote, which has hitherto,
it would seem, remained unknown, and in which she
recites that, on arriving in England, she was promptly
welcomed by Miles of Gloucester "sicut illam quam
justam hæredem regni Angliæ recognovit."</p>

<p>The sex of the Empress was the drawback to her claim.
Had her brother lived, there can be little question that he
would, as a matter of course, have succeeded his father
at his death. Or again, had Henry II. been old enough
to succeed his grandfather, he would, we may be sure,
have done so. But as to the Empress, even admitting the
justice of her claim, it was by no means clear in whom it
was vested. It might either be vested (<i>a</i>) in herself, in
accordance with our modern notions; or (<i>b</i>) in her husband,
in accordance with feudal ones;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_95" id="Ref_95" href="#Foot_95">[95]</a></span> or (<i>c</i>) in her son, as, in
the event, it was. It may be said that this point was still
undecided as late as 1142, when Geoffrey was invited to
come to England, and decided to send his son instead,
to represent the hereditary claim. The force of circumstances,
however, as we shall find, had compelled the
Empress, in the hour of her triumph (1141), to take her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
own course, and to claim the throne for herself as queen,
though even this would not decide the point, as, had she
succeeded, her husband, we may be sure, would have
claimed the title of king.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, to sum up the evidence here collected,
it tends to the belief that the obsolescence of the
right of election to the English crown presents considerable
analogy to that of canonical election in the case of
English bishoprics. In both cases a free election
degenerated into a mere assent to a choice already made.
We see the process of change already in full operation
when Henry I. endeavours to extort beforehand from
the magnates their assent to his daughter's succession,
and when they subsequently complain of this attempt
to dictate to them on the subject. We catch sight of it
again when his daughter bases her claim to the crown,
not on any free election, but on her rights as her father's
heir, confirmed by the above assent. We see it, lastly,
when Stephen, though owing his crown to election, claims
to rule by Divine right ("Dei gratia"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_96" id="Ref_96" href="#Foot_96">[96]</a></span>), and attempts to
reduce that election to nothing more than a national
"assent" to his succession. Obviously, the whole question
turned on whether the election was to be held first,
or was to be a mere ratification of a choice already made.
Thus, at the very time when Stephen was formulating his
title, he was admitting, in the case of the bishopric of
Bath, that the canonical election had <i>preceded</i> his own
nomination of the bishop.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_97" id="Ref_97" href="#Foot_97">[97]</a></span> Yet it is easy to see how,
as the Crown grew in strength, the elections, in both cases
alike, would become, more and more, virtually matters of
form, while a weak sovereign or a disputed succession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
would afford an opportunity for this historical survival,
in the case at least of the throne, to recover for a moment
its pristine strength.</p>

<p>Before quitting the point, I would venture briefly to
resume my grounds for urging that, in comparing Stephen
with his successor, the difference between their circumstances
has been insufficiently allowed for. At Stephen's
accession, thirty years of legal and financial oppression
had rendered unpopular the power of the Crown, and had
led to an impatience of official restraint which opened the
path to a feudal reaction: at the accession of Henry, on
the contrary, the evils of an enfeebled administration and
of feudalism run mad had made all men eager for the
advent of a strong king, and had prepared them to welcome
the introduction of his centralizing administrative reforms.
He anticipated the position of the house of Tudor at the
close of the Wars of the Roses, and combined with it the
advantages which Charles II. derived from the Puritan
tyranny. Again, Stephen was hampered from the first
by his weak position as a king on sufferance, whereas
Henry came to his work unhampered by compact or concession.
Lastly, Stephen was confronted throughout by
a rival claimant, who formed a splendid rallying-point for
all the discontent in his realm: but Henry reigned for as
long as Stephen without a rival to trouble him; and when
he found at length a rival in his own son, a claim far
weaker than that which had threatened his predecessor
seemed likely for a time to break his power as effectually
as the followers of the Empress had broken that of Stephen.
He may only, indeed, have owed his escape to that efficient
administration which years of strength and safety had
given him the time to construct.</p>

<p>It in no way follows from these considerations that
Henry was not superior to Stephen; but it does, surely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
suggest itself that Stephen's disadvantages were great, and
that had he enjoyed better fortune, we might have heard
less of his defects. It will be at least established by
the evidence adduced in this work that some of the
charges which are brought against him can no longer
be maintained.</p>

There is a curious incidental allusion to the earl's Kentish possessions
in William of Malmesbury, who states (p. 759) that he was allowed, while
a prisoner at Rochester (October, 1141), to receive his rents from his Kentish
tenants ("ab hominibus suis de Cantia"). Stephen, then, it would seem, did
not forfeit them.</p>

In the rebellion of 1138 Walchelin Maminot, the earl's castellan, held
Dover against Stephen, and was besieged by the Queen and by the men of
Boulogne. Curiously enough, Mr. Freeman made a similar slip, now corrected,
to that here discussed, when he wrote that "whatever might be
the feelings of the rest of the shire, the men of Dover had no mind to see
Count Eustace again within their walls" (<i>Norm. Conq.</i>, iv. 116), though they
were, on the contrary, quite as anxious as the rest of the shire to do so.</p>

"Id quoque sui esse juris, suique specialiter privilegii ut si rex ipsorum

as vested in themselves is much stronger than Mr. Freeman's paraphrase
when he speaks of "the citizens of London and Winchester [why Winchester?],

of the king who should reign over them" (<i>Norm. Conq.</i>, v. 251; cf. p. 856).</p>

The phrase "districto Sacramento" is very difficult to construe. I
have here taken it to imply a release of Stephen from his oath, but the
meaning of the passage, which is obscure as it stands, may be merely that
Henry became surety for Stephen's performance of the oath as in an agreement
or treaty between two contracting parties (<i>vide infra passim</i>).</p>

Speaking of the late king's trusted friends, who hung back from coming
to court, he writes: "Illi autem, intentâ sibi a rege comminatione, cum

I am inclined to believe that in Robert fitz Richard we have that Robert
fitz Richard (de Clare) who died in 1137 (Robert de Torigny), being then
described as paternal uncle to Richard fitz Gilbert (de Clare), usually but
erroneously described as first Earl of Hertford. If so, he was also uncle to
Baldwin (fitz Gilbert) de Clare of this charter, and brother to W(alter) fitz
Richard (de Clare), another witness. We shall come across another of Stephen's
charters to which the house of Clare contributes several witnesses. There is
evidence to suggest that Robert fitz Richard (de Clare) was lord, in some
way, of Maldon in Essex, and was succeeded there by (his nephew) Walter
fitz Gilbert (de Clare), who went on crusade (probably in 1147).</p>

"Fama per Angliam volitabat, quod comes Gloecestræ Robertus, qui
erat in Normannia, in proximo partes sororis foret adjuturus, <i>rege tantummodo

enim post Pentecosten missis a Normanniâ suis regi <i>more majorum amicitiam

juste faceret, quia et rex illicite ad regnum aspiraverat, et omnem fidem
sibi juratam neglexerat, ne dicam mentitus fuerat" (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, 712). So,
too, the Continuator of Florence: "Interim facta conjuratione adversus
regem per prædictum Brycstowensem comitem et conestabularium Milonem,
<i>abnegata fidelitate quam illi juraverant</i>, ... Milo constabularius, <i>regiæ
majestati redditis fidei sacramentis</i>, ad dominum suum, comitem Gloucestrensem,
cum grandi manu militum se contulit" (pp. 110, 117). Compare with
these passages the extraordinary complaint made against Stephen's conduct
in attacking Lincoln without sending a formal "defiance" to his opponents,
and the singular treaty, in this reign, between the Earls of Chester and of
Leicester, in which the latter was bound not to attack the former, as his
lord, without sending him the formal "diffidatio" a clear fortnight beforehand.</p>

"In a later stage, when the son of his rival was firm on the throne, the
doctrine of female succession took root under a king who by the spindle-side
sprang from both William and Cerdic, but who by the spear-side had nothing
to do with either. Then it was that men began to find out that Stephen had
been guilty not only of breaking his oath, but also of defrauding the heir to
the crown of her lawful right" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 252).</p>

Oddly enough, the correct date must be sought from Symeon of Durham,
though, at first sight, he is the most inaccurate, as he places the event under
1128 (a date accepted, in the margin, by his editor) instead of 1126, the year
given by the other chroniclers. But from him we learn that the Christmas
court (<i>i.e.</i> Christmas 1126) was adjourned from Windsor to London, for the
new year, "ubi Circumcisione Domini" (January 1) the actual oath was taken.
William of Malmesbury dates it, loosely, at Christmas (1126), but the Continuator
of Florence, more accurately, "finitis diebus festivioribus" (p. 84),
which confirms Symeon's statement.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_88" id="Foot_88" href="#Ref_88">[88]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is scarcely realized so clearly as it should be that the oath taken on
this occasion was that to which reference was always made. Dr. Stubbs
(<i>Const. Hist.</i>, i. 341) recognizes "a similar oath in 1131" (on the authority
of William of Malmesbury), and another in 1133 (on the authority of Roger
of Hoveden). But the former is only incidentally mentioned, and is neither
alluded to elsewhere, nor referred to subsequently by William himself; and
the latter, which is similarly devoid of any contemporary confirmation, is
represented as securing the succession, not to Matilda, but to her son. It is
strange that so recent and important an oath as this, if it was really taken,
should have been ignored in the controversy under Stephen, and the earlier
oath, described above, alone appealed to.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_89" id="Foot_89" href="#Ref_89">[89]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Henry of Huntingdon merely alludes to it, retrospectively, at Stephen's
accession, as the "sacramentum fidelitatis Anglici regni filiæ regis Henrici"
(p. 256).</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_90" id="Foot_90" href="#Ref_90">[90]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Fecit principes et potentes adjurare eidem filiæ suæ et heredibus suis
legitimis regnum Angliæ" (i. 93). This is, perhaps, somewhat confirmed by
the words which the author of the <i>Gesta</i> places in the primate's mouth (p. 7).</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_91" id="Foot_91" href="#Ref_91">[91]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
"In filiam suam, sororem scilicet Willelmi, ... regni jura transferebat"
(p. 85). The oath to secure her this succession was taken "ad jussum regis"
(p. 84). Compare with this expression that of Gervase above, and that
(<i>quantum valeat</i>) of Roger Hoveden, viz. "<i>constituit</i> eum regem;" also the
"jubente rege" of Symeon in 1120. It was accordingly urged, at Stephen's
accession, that the oath had been compulsory, and was therefore invalid.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_92" id="Foot_92" href="#Ref_92">[92]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Juraverunt ut filiæ suæ imperatrici fide servata regnum Angliæ <i>hæreditario
jure</i> post eum servarent" (p. 281). Compare William of Newburgh,
on Henry's accession: "Hæreditarium regnum suscepit." These expressions
are the more noteworthy because of the contrast they afford to the Conqueror's
dying words, "Neminem Anglici constituo heredem ... non enim tantum
decus hereditario jure possedi" (<i>Ord. Vit.</i>).</p>

That the oath of January 1, 1127, preceding the marriage of the
Empress, was, as I have urged, the ruling one seems to be further implied
by the passage in William of Malmesbury: "Ego Rogerum Salesbiriensem
episcopum sæpe dicentem audivi, 'Solutum se sacramento quod imperatrici
fecerat: eo enim pacto se jurasse, ne rex præter consilium suum et cæterorum
procerum filiam cuiquam nuptam daret extra regnum,'" etc., etc. (p. 693).</p>

As for instance when Henry II. obtained Aquitaine with his wife.
There is, as it happens, a passage in Symeon of Durham, which may have
been somewhat overlooked, where it is distinctly stated that in the autumn
of the year (1127), Henry conceded, as a condition of the Angevin match,
that, in default of his having a son, Geoffrey of Anjou should succeed him
("remque ad effectum perduxit eo tenore ut regi, de legitima conjuge hæredem
non habenti, mortuo <i>gener illius</i> in regnum succederet"). That Geoffrey's
claim was recognized at the time is clear from the striking passage quoted
by Mr. Freeman from his panegyrist ("sceptro ... non injuste aspirante"),
and even more so from the explicit statement: "Volente igitur Gaufrido
comite cum uxore suâ, quæ hæres erat [here again is an allusion to her
hereditary right], in regnum succedere, primores terræ, juramenti sui male
recordantes, reg<i>em</i> e<i>um</i> suscipere noluerunt, dicentes 'Alienigena non
regnabit super nos'" (<i>Select Charters</i>, p. 110).</p>

royal charters on which my story is so largely based.
It is therefore beyond dispute. But though there is no
pedigree of the period clearer or better established, it has
formed the subject of an amazing blunder, so gross as to
be scarcely credible. Madox had shown, in his <i>History of
the Exchequer</i> (ii. 400), that Geoffrey "Fitz Piers" (Earl of
Essex from 1199 to 1213) was Sheriff of Essex and Herts in
1192-94 (4 &amp; 5 Ric. I.). Now Geoffrey, the son of Geoffrey
"Fitz Piers," assuming the surname of "De Mandeville,"
became his successor in the earldom of Essex, which he
held from 1213 to 1216. The noble and learned authors
of the <i>Lords' Reports on the Dignity of a Peer</i> began by
confusing this Geoffrey with his namesake the earl of 1141,
and bodily transferring to the latter the whole parentage
of the former. Thus they evolved the startling discovery
that the father of our Geoffrey, the earl of 1141, "was
Geoffrey Fitz Peter [<i>i.e.</i> the earl of 1199-1213], and probably
was son of Peter, the sheriff at the time of the
Survey."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_105" id="Ref_105" href="#Foot_105">[105]</a></span> But not content even with this, they transferred
the shrievalty of Geoffrey "Fitz Piers" from 1192-94 (<i>vide
supra</i>)<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_106" id="Ref_106" href="#Foot_106">[106]</a></span> to a date earlier than the grant to Geoffrey de
Mandeville (his supposed son) in 1141. Now, during that
shrievalty the Earls "of Clare" enjoyed the <i>tertius denarius</i>
of the county of Hertford. Thus their lordships were
enabled to produce the further discovery that the Earls
"of Clare" enjoyed it before the date of this grant (1141),
that is to say, "either before or early in the reign of
King Stephen."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_107" id="Ref_107" href="#Foot_107">[107]</a></span> The authority of these Reports has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
been so widely recognized that we cannot wonder at
Courthope stating in his <i>Historic Peerage of England</i>
(p. 248) that "Richard de Clare ... was Earl of Hertford,
and possessed of the third penny of that county,
before or early in the reign of King Stephen." Courthope
has in turn misled Dr. Stubbs,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_108" id="Ref_108" href="#Foot_108">[108]</a></span> and Mr. Doyle has now
followed suit, stating that Richard de Clare was "created
Earl of Hertford (about) 1136."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_109" id="Ref_109" href="#Foot_109">[109]</a></span> It is therefore something
to have traced this error to its original source in the
<i>Lords' Reports</i>.</p>

<p>The first mention, it would seem, of the subject of this
study is to be found in the Pipe-Roll of 1130, where we
read—</p>

<p class="small">"Gaufridus de Mandeville reddit compotum de Dccclxvj<i>li.</i> et xiii<i>s.</i> et
iiij<i>d.</i> pro terra patris sui. In thesauro cxxxiii<i>li.</i> et vi<i>s.</i> et viii<i>d.</i></p>

<p class="small">"Et debet Dcc et xxxiij<i>li.</i> et vj<i>s.</i> et viij<i>d.</i>" (p. 55).</p>

<p>As he had thus, at Michaelmas, 1130, paid only two-thirteenths
of the amount due from him for succession,
that is the (arbitrary) "relief" to the Crown, we may infer
that his father was but lately dead. He does not again
meet us till he appears at Stephen's court early in 1136.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_110" id="Ref_110" href="#Foot_110">[110]</a></span>
From the date of that appearance we pass to his creation
as an earl by the first of those royal charters with which
we are so largely concerned.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_111" id="Ref_111" href="#Foot_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
The date of this charter is a point of no small interest,
not merely because we have in it the only surviving charter
of creation of those issued by Stephen, but also because
there is reason to believe that it is the oldest extant charter
of creation known to English antiquaries. That distinction
has indeed been claimed for the second charter in
my series, namely, that which Geoffrey obtained from the
Empress Maud. It is of the latter that Camden wrote,
"This is the most ancient creation-charter that I ever
saw."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_112" id="Ref_112" href="#Foot_112">[112]</a></span> Selden duly followed suit, and Dugdale echoed
Selden's words.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_113" id="Ref_113" href="#Foot_113">[113]</a></span> Courthope merely observes that it "is
presumed to be one of the very earliest charters of express
creation of the title of earl;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_114" id="Ref_114" href="#Foot_114">[114]</a></span> and Mr. Birch pronounces
it "one of the earliest, if not the earliest, example of a
deed creating a peerage."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_115" id="Ref_115" href="#Foot_115">[115]</a></span> In despite, however, of these
opinions I am prepared to prove that the charter with
which we are now dealing is entitled to the first place,
though that of the Empress comes next.</p>

<p>We cannot begin an investigation of the subject better
than by seeking the opinion of Mr. Eyton, who was a
specialist in the matter of charters and their dates, and
who had evidently investigated the point. His note on
this charter is as follows:—</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Stephen's earlier deeds of 1136 exhibit Geoffrey de Magnaville as
a baron only. There are three such, two of which certainly, and the
third probably, passed at Westminster. He was custos of the Tower
of London, an office which probably necessitated a constant residence.
There are three patents of creation extant by which he became Earl of
Essex. Those which I suppose to precede this were by the Empress.
The first of them passed in the short period during which Maud was
in London, <i>i.e.</i> between June 24 and July 25, 1141. The second within
a month after, at Oxford. In the latter she alludes to grants of lands
previously made by Stephen to the said Geoffrey, but to no patent of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
earldom except her own. Selden calls Maud's London patent the
oldest on record. It is not perhaps that, but it is older than this,
though Dugdale thought not. Having decided that Stephen's patent
succeeded Maud's, it follows that it (viz. this charter) passed after
Nov. 1, 1141, when Stephen regained his liberty and Geoffrey probably
forsook the empress. The king was at London on Dec. 7. In 1142 we
are told (Lysons, <i>Camb.</i>, 9) that this Geoffrey and Earl Gilbert were
sent by Stephen against the Isle of Ely. He is called earl. We shall
also have him attesting a charter of Queen Matilda (Stephen's wife).</p>

<p>"In 1143 he was seized in Stephen's court at St. Alban's.</p>

<p>"In 1144 he is in high rebellion against Stephen, and an ally of
Nigel, Bishop of Ely. He is killed in Aug., 1144.</p>

<p>"On the whole then it would appear that the Empress first made
him an earl as a means of securing London, the stronghold of Stephen's
party, but that, on Stephen's release, the earl changed sides and Stephen
opposed Maud's policy by a counter-patent (we have usually found
counter-charters, however, to be Maud's). We have also a high probability
that this charter passed in Dec., 1141, or soon after; for Stephen
does not appear at London in 1142, when Geoffrey is earl and in
Stephen's employ."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_116" id="Ref_116" href="#Foot_116">[116]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Here I must first clear the ground by explaining as to
the "three patents of creation" mentioned in this passage,
that there were only <i>two</i> charters (not "patents") of
creation—that of the king, which survives in the original,
and that of the Empress, which is known to us from a
transcript. As to the latter, it certainly "passed in the
short period during which Maud was in London," but
that period, so far from being "between June 24 and July
25, 1141," consisted only of a few days ending with "June
24, 1141." The main point, however, at issue is the
priority of the creation-charters. It will be seen that
Mr. Eyton jumped at his conclusion, and then proceeded:
"Having decided," etc. This is the more surprising
because that conclusion was at variance with what he
admits to have been his own principle, namely, that he
had "usually found counter-charters to be Maud's."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_117" id="Ref_117" href="#Foot_117">[117]</a></span> In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
this case his conclusion was wrong, and his original
principle was right. I think that Mr. Eyton's error was
due to his ignorance of the second charter granted by the
king to Geoffrey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_118" id="Ref_118" href="#Foot_118">[118]</a></span> As he was well acquainted with the
royal charters in the duchy of Lancaster collection it is
not easy to understand how he came to overlook this very
long one, which is, as it were, the keystone to the arch I
am about to construct.</p>

<p>It is my object to make Geoffrey's charters prove their
own sequence. When once arranged in their right order,
it will be clear from their contents that this order is the
only one possible. We must not attempt to decide their
dates till we have determined their order. But when that
order has been firmly established, we can approach the
question of dates with comparative ease and confidence.</p>

<p>To determine from internal evidence the sequence of
these charters, we must arrange them in an ascending
scale. That is to say, each charter should represent an
advance on its immediate predecessor. Tried by this test,
our four main charters will assume, beyond dispute, this
relative order.</p>

<div class="charter">

<ol>
 <li>First charter of the king.</li>
 <li>First charter of the Empress.</li>
 <li>Second charter of the king.</li>
 <li>Second charter of the Empress.</li>
</ol>

</div>

<p>The order of the three last is further established by
the fact that the grants in the second are specifically confirmed
by the third, while the third is expressly referred
to in the fourth. The only one, therefore, about which
there could possibly be a question is the first, and the fact
that the second charter represents a great advance upon it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
is in this case the evidence. But there is, further, the fact
that the place I have assigned it is the only one in the series
that it can possibly occupy. Nor could Mr. Eyton have
failed to arrive at this conclusion had he included within
his sphere of view the second charter of the king.</p>

<p>It is clear that Mr. Eyton was here working from
the statements of Dugdale alone. For the three charters
he deals with are those which Dugdale gives. The order
assigned to these charters by Dugdale and Mr. Eyton
respectively can be thus briefly shown:—</p>

<table class="order" summary="">

<tr>
 <td>Right order</td>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>2</td>
 <td></td>
 <td>3</td>
 <td>4</td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>Eyton's order</td>
 <td></td>
 <td>2</td>
 <td>4</td>
 <td>1</td>
 <td></td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td>Dugdale'a order</td>
 <td>1</td>
 <td>4</td>
 <td>2</td>
 <td></td>
 <td></td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>How gravely Mr. Eyton erred in his conclusions will be
obvious from this table. But it is necessary to go further
still, and to say that of the seven charters affecting
Geoffrey de Mandeville, three would seem to have been
unknown to him, while of the rest, he assigned three, one
might almost say all four, to a demonstrably erroneous
date. It may be urged that this is harsh criticism, and
the more so as its subject was never published, and exists
only in the form of notes. There is much to be said for
this view, but the fact remains that rash use is certain to
be made of these notes, unless students are placed on their
guard. That this should be so is due not only to Mr.
Eyton's great and just reputation as a laborious student
in this field, but also to the exaggerated estimate of the
value and correctness of these notes which was set, somewhat
prominently, before the public.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_119" id="Ref_119" href="#Foot_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>Advancing from the question of position to that of
actual date, we will glance at the opinion of another expert,
Mr. Walter de Gray Birch. We learn from him, as to the
date of this first creation-charter, that—</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></div>

<p class="small">"The dates of the witnesses appear to range between <small>A.D.</small> 1139 and
<small>A.D.</small> 1144.... The actual date of the circumstances mentioned in this
document is a matter of question.... He [Geoffrey] was slain on the
14th of September, <small>A.D.</small> 1144, and therefore this document must be
prior to that date."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_120" id="Ref_120" href="#Foot_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>We see now that it is by no means easy to date this
charter with exactness. It will be best, in pursuance of
my usual practice, to begin by clearing the ground.</p>

<p>If we could place any trust in the copious chronicle of
Walden Abbey, which is printed (in part) in the <i>Monasticon</i>
from the Arundel manuscript, our task would be easy
enough. For we are there told that Stephen had already
created Geoffrey an earl when, in 1136, he founded Walden
Abbey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_121" id="Ref_121" href="#Foot_121">[121]</a></span> And, in his foundation charter, he certainly
styles himself an earl.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_122" id="Ref_122" href="#Foot_122">[122]</a></span> But, alas for this precious narrative,
it brings together at the ceremony three bishops,
Robert of London, Nigel of Ely, and William of Norwich,
of whom Robert of London was not appointed till 1141,
while William of Norwich did not obtain that see till
1146!</p>

<p>Dismissing, therefore, this evidence, we turn to the
fact that no creation of an earldom by Stephen is mentioned
before 1138. But we have something far more
important than this in the occurrence at the head of the
witnesses to this creation-charter, of the name of William
of Ypres, the only name, indeed, among the witnesses that
strikes one as a note of time. Mr. Eyton wrote: "A
deed which I have dated 1140 ... is his first known
attestation."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_123" id="Ref_123" href="#Foot_123">[123]</a></span> I have found no evidence contrary to this
conclusion. It would seem probable that when the arrest
of the bishops "gave," in Dr. Stubbs' words, "the signal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
for the civil war," Stephen's preparations for the
approaching struggle would include the summons to his
side of this experienced leader, who had hitherto been
fighting in Normandy for his cause. Indeed, we know
that it was so, for he was at once despatched against the
castle of Devizes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_124" id="Ref_124" href="#Foot_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Happily, however, there remains a writ, which should
incidentally, we shall find, prove the key to the problem.
This, which is printed among the footnotes in Madox's
<i>Baronia Anglica</i> (p. 231), from the muniments of Westminster
Abbey, is addressed "Gaufrido de Magnavilla"
simply, and is, therefore, previous to his elevation to the
earldom. Now, as this writ refers to the death of Roger,
Bishop of Salisbury, it must be later than the 11th of
December, 1139.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_125" id="Ref_125" href="#Foot_125">[125]</a></span> Consequently Geoffrey's charter must be
subsequent to that date. It must also be previous to the
battle of Lincoln (February, 1141), because, as I observed at
the outset, it must be previous to the charter of the Empress.
We therefore virtually narrow its limit to the year 1140,
for Stephen had set out for Lincoln before the close of the
year.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_126" id="Ref_126" href="#Foot_126">[126]</a></span> Let us try and reduce it further still. What was
the date of the above writ? Stephen, on the death of
Bishop Roger, hastened to visit Salisbury.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_127" id="Ref_127" href="#Foot_127">[127]</a></span> He went there
from Oxford to spend Christmas (1139), and then returned
to Reading (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>). Going and returning he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
would have passed through Andover, the place at which
this writ is tested. Thus it could have been, and probably
was, issued at this period (December, 1139). Obviously,
if it was issued in the course of 1140, this would reduce
still further the possible limit within which Geoffrey's
charter can have passed. Difficult though it is to trace
the incessant movements of the king throughout this
troubled year, he certainly visited Winchester, and (probably
thence) Malmesbury. Still we have not, I believe,
proof of his presence at Andover.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_128" id="Ref_128" href="#Foot_128">[128]</a></span> And there are other
grounds, I shall now show, for thinking that the earldom
was conferred before March, 1140.</p>

<p>William of Newburgh, speaking of the arrest of Geoffrey
de Mandeville, assures us that Stephen bore an old grudge
against him, which he had hitherto been forced to conceal.
Its cause was a gross outrage by Geoffrey, who, on the
arrival of Constance of France, the bride of Eustace the
heir-apparent, had forcibly detained her in the Tower.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_129" id="Ref_129" href="#Foot_129">[129]</a></span>
We fix the date of this event as February or March, 1140,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
from the words of the Continuator of Florence,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_130" id="Ref_130" href="#Foot_130">[130]</a></span> and that
date agrees well with Henry of Huntingdon's statement,
that Stephen had bought his son's bride with the treasure
he obtained by the death of the great Bishop of Salisbury
(December 11, 1139).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_131" id="Ref_131" href="#Foot_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>It would seem, of course, highly improbable that this
audacious insult to the royal family would have been
followed by the grant of an earldom. We might consequently
infer that, in all likelihood, Geoffrey had already
obtained his earldom.</p>

<p>We have, however, to examine the movements of
Stephen at the time. The king returned, as we saw, to
Reading, after spending his Christmas at Salisbury. He
was then summoned to the Fen country by the revolt of
the Bishop of Ely, and he set out thither, says Henry of
Huntingdon, "post Natale" (p. 267). He <i>may</i> have taken
Westminster on his way, but there is no evidence that he
did. He had, however, returned to London by the middle
of March, to take part in a Mid-Lent council.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_132" id="Ref_132" href="#Foot_132">[132]</a></span> His movements
now become more difficult to trace than ever, but
it may have been after this that he marched on Hereford
and Worcester.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_133" id="Ref_133" href="#Foot_133">[133]</a></span> Our next glimpse of him is at Whitsuntide
(May 26), when he kept the festival in sorry state at
the Tower.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_134" id="Ref_134" href="#Foot_134">[134]</a></span> It has been suggested that it was for security
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
that he sought the shelter of its walls. But this explanation
is disposed of by the fact that the citizens of London
were his best friends and proved, the year after, the virtual
salvation of his cause. It would seem more likely that he
was anxious to reassert his impaired authority and to
destroy the effect of Geoffrey's outrage, which might otherwise
have been ruinous to his <i>prestige</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_135" id="Ref_135" href="#Foot_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>It was, as I read it, at the close of Whitsuntide, that
is, about the beginning of June, that the king set forth for
East Anglia, and, attacking Hugh Bigod, took his castle of
Bungay.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_136" id="Ref_136" href="#Foot_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>In August the king again set forth to attack Hugh
Bigod;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_137" id="Ref_137" href="#Foot_137">[137]</a></span> and either to this, or to his preceding East
Anglian campaign, we may safely assign his charter,
granted at Norwich, to the Abbey of Reading.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_138" id="Ref_138" href="#Foot_138">[138]</a></span> Now, the
first witness to this charter is Geoffrey de Mandeville himself,
who is not styled an earl. We learn, then, that, at
least as late as June, 1140, Geoffrey had not received his
earldom. This would limit the date of his creation to
June-December, 1140, or virtually, at the outside, a period
of six months.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the ultimate conclusion to which our
inquiry leads us. And if it be asked why Stephen should
confer an earldom on Geoffrey at this particular time,
the reply is at hand in the condition of affairs, which had
now become sufficiently critical for Geoffrey to begin the
game he had made up his mind to play. For Stephen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
could not with prudence refuse his demand for an
earldom.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_139" id="Ref_139" href="#Foot_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The first corollary of this conclusion is that "the
second type" of Stephen's great seal (which is that
appended to this charter) must have been already in use
in the year 1140, that is to say, before his fall in 1141.</p>

<p>Mr. Birch, who, I need hardly say, is the recognized
authority on the subject, has devoted one of his learned
essays on the Great Seals of the Kings of England to those
of Stephen.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_140" id="Ref_140" href="#Foot_140">[140]</a></span> He has appended to it photographs of the
two types in use under this sovereign, and has given
the text of nineteen original sealed charters, which he has
divided into two classes according to the types of their
seals. The conclusion at which he arrived as the result
of this classification was that the existence of "two distinctly
variant types" is proved (all traces of a third, if
it ever existed, being now lost), one of which represents the
earlier, and the other the later, portion of the reign.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_141" id="Ref_141" href="#Foot_141">[141]</a></span> To
the former belong nine, and to the latter ten of the charters
which he quotes in his paper. The only point on which a
question can arise is the date at which the earlier was replaced
by the later type. Mr. Birch is of opinion that—</p>

<p class="small">"the consideration of the second seal tends to indicate the alteration
of the type subsequent to his liberation from the hands of the Empress,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
and it is most natural to suppose that this alteration is owing to the
destruction or loss of his seal consequent to his own capture and
incarceration" (p. 15).</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that this is the most natural
suggestion; but if, as I contend, the very first two of the
charters adduced by Mr. Birch as specimens of the later
type are previous to "his capture and incarceration," it
follows that his later great seal must have been adopted
before that event. One of these charters is that which
forms the subject of this chapter; the other is preserved
among the records of the duchy of Lancaster.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_142" id="Ref_142" href="#Foot_142">[142]</a></span>
At the date when the latter was granted, the king was
in possession of the temporalities of the see of Lincoln,
which he had seized on the arrest of the bishops in
June, 1139. As Alexander had regained possession of
his see by the time of the battle of Lincoln, this charter
must have passed before Stephen's capture, and most
probably passed a year or more before. We have then
to account for the adoption by Stephen of a new great
seal, certainly before 1141, and possibly as early as 1139.
Is it not possible that this event may be connected with the
arrest of the chancellor and his mighty kinsmen in June,
1139, and that the seal may have been made away with in
his and their interest, as on the flight of James II., in order

<p>Taking this, as I believe it to be, as our earliest charter
of creation extant or even known, the chief point to attract
our notice is its intensely hereditary character. Geoffrey
receives the earldom "hereditarie," for himself "et
heredes sui post eum hereditario jure." The terms in
which the grant is made are of tantalizing vagueness;
and, compared with the charters by which it was followed,
this is remarkable for its brevity, and for the total omission
of those accompanying concessions which the statements
of our historians would lead us to expect without fail.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>We must now pass from the grant of this charter to
the great day of Lincoln (February 2, 1141), where the fortunes
of England and her king were changed "in the
twinkling of an eye" by the wild charge of "the Disinherited,"
as they rode for death or victory.<span class="fnanchor"><a

There is a curious story in the Waltham Chronicle (<i>De Inventione</i>,
cap. xiii.) that the Conqueror placed Geoffrey in the shoes of Esegar the
staller. The passage runs thus: "Cui [Tovi] successit filius ejus Adelstanus
pater Esegari qui stalra inventus est in Angliæ conquisitione a Normannis,
cuius hereditatem postea dedit conquisitor terræ, rex Willelmus, Galfrido de
Mandevile proavi presentis comitis Willelmi. Successit quidem Adelstanus
patri suo Tovi, non in totam quidem possessionem quam possederat pater, sed
in eam tantum quæ pertinebat ad stallariam, quam nunc habet comes
Willelmus." The special interest of this story lies in the official connection
of Esegar [or Ansgar] the staller with London and Middlesex, combined with
the fact that Geoffrey occupied the same position. See p. 354, and Addenda.</p>

firmitas turris Londoniarum custodienda committitur. Nobili cum Rege
magnificé plura gessit patri non immerito in rebus agendis coæqualis"
(<i>Monasticon</i>). Dugdale's error, as we might expect, is followed by later
writers, Mr. Clark treating Geoffrey as the first "hereditary constable," and
his son, whom with characteristic inaccuracy he transforms from "William"
into "Walter," as the second (<i>Mediæval Military Architecture</i>, ii. 253, 254).
The French editors of Ordericus (iv. 108) strangely imagined that William
was brother, not son, of Geoffrey de Mandeville.</p>

It is necessary to check by authentic charters and other trustworthy
evidence the chronicles printed in the <i>Monasticon</i> under Walden Abbey.
One of these was taken from a long and interesting MS., formerly in the
possession of the Royal Society, but now among the Arundel MSS. in the
British Museum. This, which is only partially printed, and which ought to
be published in its entirety, has the commencement wanting, and is,
unfortunately, very inaccurate for the early period of which I treat. It is
this narrative which makes the wild misstatements as to the circumstances of
the foundation, which grossly misdates Geoffrey's death, etc., etc. All its
statements are accepted by Dugdale. The other chronicle, which he printed
from Cott. MS., Titus, D. 20, is far more accurate, gives Geoffrey's death correctly,
and rightly assigns him as wife the <i>sister</i> (not the daughter) of the
Earl of Oxford, thus correcting Dugdale's error. It is the latter chronicle
which Dugdale has misquoted with reference to the charge of the Tower.</p>

"Madox ... has shown ... that Geoffrey Fitzpeter, Earl of Essex,
obtained from the Crown Grants of the shrievalty of the Counties of Essex
and Hertford when the Earls, commonly called Earls of Clare, were Earls of
Hertford, and had the Third Penny of the Pleas of that County" (iii. 69,
ed. 1829).</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_107" id="Foot_107" href="#Ref_107">[107]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The County of Hertford appears to have been, at the time of the
Survey, in the King's hands, and Peter was then Sheriff; and the Sheriffwick
of Hertfordshire was afterwards granted in Fee, by the Empress Maud, to
Geoffrey de Mandeville, Earl of Essex, at a rent as his father and grandfather
had held it. The  father  of  Geoffrey was Geoffrey Fitz Peter, and
probably was son of Peter, the Sheriff at the time of the Survey. The first
trace which the Committee has discovered of the title of the Earls of Clare
to the Third Penny of the County is in the reign of Henry the Second,
subsequent to the grants under which the Earls of Essex claimed the
Shrievalty in fee, at a fee-farm rent. But the grant of the Third Penny must
have been of an earlier date, as the grant to the Earl of Essex was subject
to that charge. The family of Clare must therefore have had the Third
Penny either before or early in the Reign of King Stephen" (iii. 125).</p>

To this visit may be assigned three charters (<i>Sarum Charters and
Documents</i>, pp. 9-11) of interest for their witnesses. Two of them are attested
by Philip the chancellor, who is immediately followed by Roger de Fécamp.
The latter had similarly followed the preceding chancellor, Roger, in one
of Stephen's charters of 1136 (see p. 263), which establishes his official
position. Among the other witnesses were Bishop Robert of Hereford,
Count Waleran of Meulan, Robert de Ver, William Martel, Robert d'Oilli
with Fulk his brother, Turgis d'Avranches, Walter de Salisbury, Ingelram
de Say, and William de Pont de l'Arche.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_128" id="Foot_128" href="#Ref_128">[128]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The "P. cancellarius," by whom the writ is tested, was a chancellor of
whom, according to Foss, virtually nothing is known. He was, however,
Philip (de Harcourt), on whom the king conferred at Winchester, in 1140,
the vacant see of Salisbury ("Rex Wintoniam veniens consilio baronum
suorum cancellario suo Philippo Searebyriensem præsulatum ... dedit"
(<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>)). But the chapter refused to accept him as bishop, and
eventually he was provided for by the see of Bayeux. He is likely, with or
without the king, to have gone straight to Salisbury after his appointment
at Winchester, in which case he would not have been present at Andover,
even if Stephen himself was.</p>

"Acceptam ab eo injuriam rex caute dissimulabat, et tempus opportunum

talis erat. Rex ante annos aliquot episcopi, ut dictum est, Salesbiriensis
thesauros adeptus, summa non modica regi Francorum Lodovico transmissa,
sororem ejus Constantiam Eustachio filio suo desponderat; ... eratque hæc
cum socru sua regina Lundoniis. Cumque regina ad alium forte vellet cum
eadem nuru sua locum migrare, memoratus Gaufridus arci tunc præsidens,
restitit; nuruque de manibus socrus, pro viribus obnitentis, abstracta atque
retenta, illam cum ignominia abire permisit. Postea vero reposcenti, et justum
motum pro tempore dissimulanti, regi socero insignem prædam ægre resignavit"

to learn from his champion (the author of the <i>Gesta Stephani</i>) that the king
spent this treasure on good and pious works. This matrimonial alliance is
deserving of careful attention, for the fact that Stephen was prepared to buy
it with treasure which he sorely needed proves its importance in his eyes as
a prop to his now threatened throne.</p>

at Winchester (see p. 47, <i>supra</i>).</p>

If, as would seem, Hugh Bigod appears first as an earl at the battle
of Lincoln, when he fought on Stephen's side, it may well be that the
"concordia" between them in August, 1140, similarly comprised the concession
by the king of comital rank. On the other hand, there is a noteworthy
charter (<i>Harl. Cart.</i>, 43, c. 13) of Stephen, which seems to belong to
the winter of 1140-1, to which Hugh Bigod is witness, not as an earl, so
that his creation may have taken place very shortly before Stephen's fall.
As this charter, according to Mr. Birch, has the second type of Stephen's
seal, it strengthens the view advanced in the text.</p>

Robert de Neufbourg, said to have been a younger son of Henry, Earl

Arundel and Robert de Novoburgo were identical." He was afterwards
Justiciary of Normandy (<i>Ord. Vit.</i>), having sided with Geoffrey of Anjou
(<i>Rot. Scacc. Norm.</i>). He is mentioned in the Pipe-Rolls of 2 and 4 Henry
II. According to Dugdale, he died (on the authority of the <i>Chronicon Normanniæ</i>),
in August, 1158, a date followed by Mr. Yeatman. Mr. Eyton,
however (<i>Court and Itinerary</i>, p. 47), on the same authority (with a reference
also to Gervase, which I cannot verify) makes him die in August, 1159. The
true date seems to have been August 30, 1159, when he died at Bec (<i>Robert

Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I. After this charter he reappears at the battle of
Lincoln (Feb. 2, 1141):—"Capitur etiam Ricardus filius Ursi, qui in ictibus
dandis recipiendisque clarus et gloriosus comparuit" (<i>Hen. Hunt.</i>, p. 274).
For his marriage to Sybil, daughter of Baldwin de Bollers by Sybil de Falaise
(<i>neptis</i> of Henry I.), see Eyton's <i>Shropshire</i>, xi. 127, and <i>Genealogist</i>, N.S., iii.
195. One would welcome information on his connection, if any, with the
terrible sheriff, Urse d'Abetot, and his impetuous son; but I know of none.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<small>TRIUMPH OF THE EMPRESS.</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">At</span>
the time of this sudden and decisive triumph, the
Empress had been in England some sixteen months. With
the Earl of Gloucester, she had landed at Arundel,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_161" id="Ref_161" href="#Foot_161">[161]</a></span> on
September 30, 1139,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_162" id="Ref_162" href="#Foot_162">[162]</a></span> and while her brother, escorted by
a few knights, made his way to his stronghold at Bristol,
had herself, attended by her Angevin suite, sought shelter
with her step-mother, the late queen, in the famous castle
of Arundel. Stephen had promptly appeared before its
walls, but, either deeming the fortress impregnable or
being misled by treacherous counsel,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_163" id="Ref_163" href="#Foot_163">[163]</a></span> had not only raised
his blockade of the castle, but had allowed the Empress to
set out for Bristol, and had given her for escort his brother
the legate, and his trusted supporter the Count of Meulan.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_164" id="Ref_164" href="#Foot_164">[164]</a></span>
From the legate her brother had received her at a spot
appointed beforehand, and had then returned with her to
Bristol. Here she was promptly visited by the constable,
Miles of Gloucester, who at once acknowledged her claims
as "the rightful heir" of England.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_165" id="Ref_165" href="#Foot_165">[165]</a></span> Escorted by him, she
removed to Gloucester, of which he was hereditary castellan,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
and received the submission of that city, and of
all the country round about.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_166" id="Ref_166" href="#Foot_166">[166]</a></span> The statements of the
chroniclers can here be checked, and are happily confirmed
and amplified by a charter of the Empress, apparently
unknown, but of great historical interest. The following
abstract is given in a transcript taken from the lost volume
of the Great Coucher of the duchy<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>It was at Gloucester that she received the news of her
brother's victory at Lincoln (February 2, 1141), and it was
there that he joined her, with his royal captive, on Quinquagesima
Sunday (February 9).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_172" id="Ref_172" href="#Foot_172">[172]</a></span> It was at once decided
that the king should be despatched to Bristol Castle,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_173" id="Ref_173" href="#Foot_173">[173]</a></span> and
that he should be there kept a prisoner for life.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_174" id="Ref_174" href="#Foot_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>In the utter paralysis of government consequent on the
king's capture, there was not a day to be lost on the part
of the Empress and her friends. The Empress herself was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
intoxicated with joy, and eager for the fruits of victory.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_175" id="Ref_175" href="#Foot_175">[175]</a></span>
Within a fortnight of the battle, she set out from
Gloucester, on what may be termed her first progress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_176" id="Ref_176" href="#Foot_176">[176]</a></span>
Her destination was, of course, Winchester, the spot to
which her eyes would at once be turned. She halted,
however, for a while at Cirencester,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_177" id="Ref_177" href="#Foot_177">[177]</a></span> to allow time for
completing the negotiations with the legate.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_178" id="Ref_178" href="#Foot_178">[178]</a></span> It was
finally agreed that, advancing to Winchester, she should
meet him in an open space, without the walls, for a conference.
This spot a charter of the Empress enables us
apparently to identify with Wherwell.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_179" id="Ref_179" href="#Foot_179">[179]</a></span> Hither, on Sunday,
the 2nd of March, a wet and gloomy day,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_180" id="Ref_180" href="#Foot_180">[180]</a></span> the clergy and
people, headed by the legate, with the monks and nuns of
the religious houses, and such magnates of the realm as
were present, streamed forth from the city to meet her.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_181" id="Ref_181" href="#Foot_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>The compact ("pactum") which followed was strictly
on the lines of that by means of which Stephen had
secured the throne. The Empress, on her part, swore that
if the legate would accept her as "domina," he should
henceforth have his way in all ecclesiastical matters. And
her leading followers swore that this oath should be kept.
Thereupon the legate agreed to receive her as "Lady of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
England," and promised her the allegiance of himself and
of his followers so long as she should keep her oath. The
whole agreement is most important, and, as such, should
be carefully studied.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_182" id="Ref_182" href="#Foot_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>On the morrow (March 3) the Empress entered Winchester,
and was received in state in the cathedral, the
legate supporting her on the right, and Bernard of St.
David's on the left.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_183" id="Ref_183" href="#Foot_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, it is most important to have a clear understanding
of what really took place upon this occasion.</p>

<p>The main points to keep before us are—(1) that there
are two distinct episodes, that of the 2nd and 3rd of March,
and that of the 7th and 8th of April, five weeks intervening
between them, during which the Empress left Winchester
to make her second progress; (2) that the first
episode was that of her <i>reception</i> at Winchester, the second
(also at Winchester) that of her <i>election</i>.</p>

<p>It is, perhaps, not surprising that our historians are
here in woeful confusion. Dr. Stubbs alone is, as usual,
right. Writing from the standpoint of a constitutional
historian, he is only concerned with the election of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
Empress, and to this he assigns its correct date.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_184" id="Ref_184" href="#Foot_184">[184]</a></span> In his
useful and excellent <i>English History</i>, Mr. Bright, on the
contrary, ignores the interval, and places the second
episode "a few days after" the first.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_185" id="Ref_185" href="#Foot_185">[185]</a></span> Professor Pearson,
whose work is that which is generally used for this period,
omits altogether the earlier episode.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_186" id="Ref_186" href="#Foot_186">[186]</a></span> Mr. Birch, on the
other hand, in his historical introduction to his valuable
<i>fasciculus</i> of the charters of the Empress, ignores altogether
the later episode, though he goes into this question with
special care. Indeed, he does more than this; for he
transfers the election itself from the later to the earlier
occasion, and assigns to the episode of March 2 and 3 the
events of April 7 and 8. This cardinal error vitiates his
elaborate argument,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_187" id="Ref_187" href="#Foot_187">[187]</a></span> and, indeed, makes confusion worse
confounded. Mr. Freeman, though, of course, in a less
degree, seems inclined to err in the same direction, when
he assigns to the earlier of the two episodes that importance
which belongs to the later.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_188" id="Ref_188" href="#Foot_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Rightly to apprehend the bearing of this episode, we
must glance back at the preceding reigns. Dr. Stubbs,
writing of Stephen's accession, observes that "the example
which Henry had set in his seizure and retention of the
crown was followed in every point by his successor."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_189" id="Ref_189" href="#Foot_189">[189]</a></span>
But on at least one main point the precedent was older
than this. The Conqueror, in 1066, and his heir, in 1087,
had both deemed it their first necessity to obtain possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
of Winchester. Winchester first, and then London,
was a rule that thus enjoyed the sanction of four successive
precedents. To secure Winchester with all that it
contained, and with all the <i>prestige</i> that its possession
would confer, was now, therefore, the object of the Empress.
This object she attained by the <i>pactum</i> of the 2nd of March,
and with it, as we have seen, the conditional allegiance of
the princely bishop of the see.</p>

<p>Now, Henry of Blois was a great man. As papal
legate, as Bishop of Winchester, and as brother to the
captive king, he possessed an influence, in his triple
capacity, which, at this eventful crisis, was probably
unrivalled in the land. But there was one thing that he
could not do—he could not presume, of his own authority,
to depose or to nominate an English sovereign. Indeed
the very fact of the subsequent election (April 8) and of
his claim, audacious as it was, that that election should
be the work of the clergy, proves that he had no thought
of the even more audacious presumption to nominate the
sovereign himself. This, then, is fatal to Mr. Birch's contention
that the Empress was, on this occasion (March 3),
elected "domina Angliæ." Indeed, as I have said, it is
based on a confusion of the two episodes. The legate, as Mr.
Birch truly says, "consented to recognize (<i>sic</i>) the Empress
as <i>Domina Angliæ</i>, or Lady, that is, Supreme Governor of
England," but, obviously, he could only do so on behalf of
himself and of his followers. We ought, therefore, to compare
his action with that of Miles of Gloucester in 1139,
when, as we have seen, in the words of the Empress—</p>

<p class="small">"<i>Recepit</i> me ut dominam et sicut illam quam justum hæredem
regni Angliæ <i>recognovit</i> ... et ibi homagium suum mihi fecit ligie
contra omnes homines."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_190" id="Ref_190" href="#Foot_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
Notice here the identity of expression—the "reception"
of the Empress and the "recognition" of her claims. I
have termed the earlier episode the "reception," and the
later the "election" of the Empress. In these terms is
precisely expressed the distinction between the two events.
Take for instances the very passages appealed to by Mr.
Birch himself:—</p>

<p class="small">"The exact words employed by William of Malmesbury are 'Nec
dubitavit Episcopus Imperatricem in Dominam Angliæ recipere'
(<i>sic</i>). In another place the same Henry de Blois declares of her, 'In
Angliæ Normanniæque Dominam eligimus' (<i>sic</i>). This regular
election of Mathildis to the dignity and office of <i>Domina Angliæ</i> took
place on Sunday, March 2, <small>A.D.</small> 1141" (p. 378).</p>

<p>Now we know, from William of Malmesbury himself, that
"the regular election in question" took place on the 8th
of April, and that the second of the passages quoted above
refers to this later episode,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_191" id="Ref_191" href="#Foot_191">[191]</a></span> while the other refers to the
earlier.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_192" id="Ref_192" href="#Foot_192">[192]</a></span> I have drawn attention to the two words (<i>recipere</i>
and <i>eligimus</i>) which he respectively applies to the "reception"
and the "election." The description of this "reception"
by William of Malmesbury<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_193" id="Ref_193" href="#Foot_193">[193]</a></span> completely tallies with
that which is given by the Empress herself in a charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_194" id="Ref_194" href="#Foot_194">[194]</a></span> It
should further be compared with the account by the author
of the <i>Gesta Stephani</i>, of the similar reception accorded to
Stephen in 1135.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_195" id="Ref_195" href="#Foot_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>But though the legate could open to the Empress the
cathedral and the cathedral city, he had no power over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
the royal castle. This we saw in the case of Stephen,
when his efforts to secure the constable's adherence were
fruitless till the king himself arrived. Probably the
constable, at this crisis, was the same William de Pont de
l'Arche, but, whoever he was, he surrendered to the
Empress the castle and all that it contained. In one
respect, indeed, she was doomed to be bitterly disappointed,
for the royal treasury, which her adventurous rival had
found filled to overflowing, was by this time all but empty.
One treasure, however, she secured; the object of her desires,
the royal crown, was placed in her triumphant hands.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_196" id="Ref_196" href="#Foot_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>To the one historian who has dealt with this incident
it has proved a stumbling-block indeed. Mr. Freeman
thus boldly attacks the problem:—</p>

<p class="small">"William of Malmesbury (<i>Hist. Nov.</i>, iii. 42) seems distinctly to
exclude a coronation; he merely says, 'Honorifica factâ processione,
recepta est in ecclesia episcopatus Wintoniæ.' We must, therefore,
see only rhetoric when the Continuator says, 'Datur ejus dominio
corona Angliæ,' and when the author of the <i>Gesta</i> (75) speaks of
'regisque castello, et regni coronâ, quam semper ardentissime
affectârat, ... in deliberationem suam contraditis,' and adds that
Henry 'dominam et <i>reginam</i> acclamare præcepit.' The Waverley
Annalist, 1141, ventures to say, 'Corona regni est ei tradita.'"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_197" id="Ref_197" href="#Foot_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only rhetoric." Ah, how easily could history be
written, if one could thus dispose of inconvenient evidence!
So far from being "rhetoric," it is precisely
because these statements are so strictly matter-of-fact
that the writer failed to grasp their meaning. Had he
known, or remembered, that the royal crown was preserved
in the royal treasury, the passage by which he is
so sorely puzzled would have proved simplicity itself.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_198" id="Ref_198" href="#Foot_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
Here again, light is thrown on these events and on the
action of the Empress by the precedent in the case of her
father (1100), who, on the death of his brother, hastened
to Winchester Castle ("ubi regalis thesaurus continebatur"),
which was formally handed over to him with all
that it contained ("arx cum regalibus gazis filio regis
Henrico reddita est").<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_199" id="Ref_199" href="#Foot_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>We have yet to consider the passage from the <i>Gesta</i>,
to which Mr. Birch so confidently appeals, and which is
dismissed by Mr. Freeman as "rhetoric." The passage
runs:—</p>

<p class="small">"In publica se civitatis et fori audientia dominam et reginam
acclamare præcepit."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_200" id="Ref_200" href="#Foot_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>By a strange coincidence it has been misconstrued by
both writers independently. Mr. Freeman, as we saw,
takes "præcepit" as referring to Henry himself, and so
does Mr. Birch.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_201" id="Ref_201" href="#Foot_201">[201]</a></span> Though the sentence as a whole may
be obscure, yet the passage quoted is quite clear. The
words are "præcepit <i>se</i>," not "præcepit illam." Thus
the proclamation, if made, was the doing of the Empress
and not of the legate. Had the legate been indeed
responsible, his conduct would have been utterly inconsistent.
But as it is, the difficulty vanishes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_202" id="Ref_202" href="#Foot_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>To the double style, "domina et regina," I have made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
reference above. My object now is to examine this
assumption of the style "regina" by the Empress. It
might perhaps be urged that the author of the <i>Gesta</i> cannot
here be implicitly relied on. His narrative, however, is
vigorous and consistent; it is in perfect harmony with
the character of the Empress; and so far as the assumption
of this style is concerned, it is strikingly confirmed
by that Oxford charter, to which we are now coming.
After her election (April 8), the Empress might claim, as
queen elect, the royal title, but if that were excusable,
which is granting much, its assumption before her election
could admit of no defence. Yet, headstrong and impetuous,
and thirsting for the throne, she would doubtless
urge that her rival's fall rendered her at once <i>de facto</i>
queen. But this was as yet by no means certain.
Stephen's brother, as we know, was talked of, and the
great nobles held aloof. The Continuator, indeed, asserts
that at Winchester (March) were "præsules pene totius
Angliæ, barones multi, principes plurimi" (p. 130), but
William, whose authority is here supreme, does not, though
writing as a partisan of the Empress, make any allusion to
their presence.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_203" id="Ref_203" href="#Foot_203">[203]</a></span> Moreover, the primate was still in doubt,
and of the five bishops who were present with the legate,
three (St. David's, Hereford, and Bath) came from
districts under the influence of the Empress, while the
other two (Lincoln and Ely) were still smarting beneath
Stephen's action of two years before (1139).</p>

<p>The special interest, therefore, of this bold proclamation
at Winchester lies in the touch it gives us of that
feminine impatience of the Empress, which led her to
grasp so eagerly the crown of England in her hands, and
now to anticipate, in this hasty manner, her election and
formal coronation.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_204" id="Ref_204" href="#Foot_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
Within a few days of her reception at Winchester, she
retraced her steps as far as Wilton, where it was arranged
that she should meet the primate, with whom were certain
bishops and some lay folk.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_205" id="Ref_205" href="#Foot_205">[205]</a></span> Theobald, however, professed
himself unable to render her homage until he had received
from the king his gracious permission to do so.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_206" id="Ref_206" href="#Foot_206">[206]</a></span> For this
purpose he went on to Bristol, while the Empress made
her way to Oxford, and there spent Easter (March 30th).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_207" id="Ref_207" href="#Foot_207">[207]</a></span>
We must probably assign to this occasion her admission
to Oxford by Robert d'Oilli.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_208" id="Ref_208" href="#Foot_208">[208]</a></span> The Continuator, indeed,
assigns it to May, and in this he is followed by modern
historians. Mr. Freeman, for instance, on his authority,
places the incident at that stage,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_209" id="Ref_209" href="#Foot_209">[209]</a></span> and so does Mr. Franck
Bright.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_210" id="Ref_210" href="#Foot_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>But the movements of the Empress, at this stage, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
really difficult to determine. Between her presence at
Oxford (March 30)<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_211" id="Ref_211" href="#Foot_211">[211]</a></span> and her presence at Reading (May
5-7),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_212" id="Ref_212" href="#Foot_212">[212]</a></span> we know nothing for certain. One would imagine
that she must have attended her own election at Winchester
(April 7, 8), but the chroniclers are silent on
the subject, though they, surely, would have mentioned
her presence. On the whole, it seems most probable
that the Continuator must be in error, when he places
the adhesion of Robert d'Oilli so late as May (at Reading)
and takes the Empress subsequently to Oxford, as if for
the first time.</p>

<p>It was, doubtless, through her "brother" Robert
"fitz Edith" that his step-father, Robert d'Oilli, was
thus won over to her cause. It should be noted that
his defection from the captive king is pointedly mentioned
by the author of the <i>Gesta</i>, even before that of the Bishop
of Winchester, thus further confirming the chronology
advanced above.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_213" id="Ref_213" href="#Foot_213">[213]</a></span> At Oxford she received the submission
of all the adjacent country,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_214" id="Ref_214" href="#Foot_214">[214]</a></span> and also executed an important
charter. This charter Mr. Birch has printed, having
apparently collated for the purpose no less than five
copies.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_215" id="Ref_215" href="#Foot_215">[215]</a></span> Its special interest is derived from the fact that
not only is it the earliest charter she is known to have
issued after Stephen's fall (with the probable exception of
that to Thurstan de Montfort), but it is also the only one
of her charters in which we find the royal phrases "ecclesiarum
<i>regni mei</i>" and "pertinentibus <i>coronæ meæ</i>." Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
Birch writes of its testing clause ("Apud Oxeneford Anno
ab Incarnatione Domini MC. quatragesimo"):</p>

<p class="small">The date of this charter is very interesting, because it is the only
example of an actual date calculated by expression of the years of the
Incarnation, which occurs among the entire series which I have been
able to collect.... Now, as the historical year in these times commenced
on the 25th of March, there is no doubt but that this charter
was granted to the Abbey of Hulme at some time between the 3rd
and the 25th of March, <small>A.D.</small> 1140-41.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_216" id="Ref_216" href="#Foot_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Eyton has also independently discussed it (though
his remarks are still in MS.), and detects, with his usual
minute care, a difficulty, in one of the three witnesses, to
which Mr. Birch does not allude.</p>

<p class="small">"St. Benet of Hulme.</p>

<p class="small">"The date given (1140) seems to combine with another circumstance
to lead to error. Matilda's style is 'Matild' Imp. H. regis filia,'
not, as usual, 'Anglorum domina.' One might therefore conclude that
the deed passed before the battle of Lincoln, and so in 1140. However,
this conclusion would be wrong, for though Matᵃ does not style herself
Queen, she asserts in the deed Royal rights and speaks of matters
pertaining 'coronæ meæ.' But we do not know that Maud was ever
in Oxford before Stephen's captivity, nor can we think it. Again, it
is certain that Robᵗ de Sigillo did not become Bishop of London till
after Easter, 1141, for at Easter, 1142, he expressly dates his own deed
'anno primo pontif' mei.' He was almost certainly appointed when
Maud was in London in July, 1141, for he attests Milo's patent of
earldom on July 25."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_217" id="Ref_217" href="#Foot_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The omission of the style "Anglorum domina" is,
however, strictly correct, and not, as Mr. Eyton thought,
singular. For it was not till her election on the 8th of
April that she became entitled to use this style. As for
her assumption of the royal phrases, it is here simply <i>ultra
vires</i>. Then, as to the attesting bishop ("R. episcopo
Londoniensi"), his presence is natural, as he was a monk
of Reading, and his position would seem to be paralleled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
by that of his predecessor Maurice, who appears as bishop
in the Survey, though, probably, only elect. As her father
"gave the bishopric of Winchester" the moment he was
elected, and before he was crowned,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_218" id="Ref_218" href="#Foot_218">[218]</a></span> so the Empress
"gave," it would seem, the see of London to Robert "of
the Seal," even before her formal election—an act, it
should be noted, thoroughly in keeping with her impetuous
assumption of the regal style. Besides the bishop and the
Earl of Gloucester, there is a third witness to this charter—"Reginaldo
filio Regis." No one, it seems, has noticed
the fact that here alone, among the charters of the Empress,
Reginald attests not as an earl, which confirms the early
date claimed for this charter. A charter which I assign
to the following May is attested by him: "Reginaldo
<i>comite</i> filio regis." This would seem to place his creation
between the dates of these charters, <i>i.e.</i> <i>circ.</i> April (1141).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_219" id="Ref_219" href="#Foot_219">[219]</a></span>
To sum up, the evidence of this charter is in complete
agreement with that of William of Malmesbury, when he
states that the Empress spent Easter (March 30) at
Oxford; and we further learn from it that she must have
arrived there at least as early as the 24th of March.</p>

<p>The fact that Mr. Freeman, in common with others,
has overlooked this early visit of the Empress in March,
is no doubt the cause of his having been misled, as I have
shown, by the Continuator's statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
The Assembly at Winchester took place, as has been
said, on the 7th and 8th of April. William of Malmesbury
was present on the occasion, and states that it was
attended by the primate "and all the bishops of
England."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_220" id="Ref_220" href="#Foot_220">[220]</a></span> This latter phrase may, however, be questioned,
in the light of subsequent charter evidence.</p>

<p>The proceedings of this council have been well
described, and are so familiar that I need not repeat them.
On the 7th was the private conclave; on the 8th, the
public assembly. I am tempted just to mention the
curiously modern incident of the legate (who presided)
commencing the proceedings by reading out the letters of
apology from those who had been summoned but were
unable to be present.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_221" id="Ref_221" href="#Foot_221">[221]</a></span> On the 8th the legate announced
to the Assembly the result of the previous day's conclave:—</p>

<p class="small">"filiam pacifici regis ... in Angliæ Normanniæque dominam
eligimus, et ei fidem et manutenementum promittimus."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_222" id="Ref_222" href="#Foot_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 9th, the deputation summoned from London
arrived and was informed of the decision; on the 10th
the assembly was dissolved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
The point I shall here select for discussion is the
meaning of the term "domina Angliæ," and the effect
of this election on the position of the Empress.</p>

<p>First, as to the term "domina Angliæ." Its territorial
character must not be overlooked. In the charters of the
Empress, her style "Ang' domina" becomes occasionally,
though very rarely, "Anglor' domina," proving that its
right extension is "Angl<i>orum</i> Domina," which differs,
as we have seen, from the chroniclers' phrase. The
importance of the distinction is this. "Rex" is royal
and national; "dominus" is feudal and territorial. We
should expect, then, the first to be followed by the nation
("Anglorum"), the second by the territory ("Angliæ").
But, in addition to its normal feudal character, the term
may here bear a special meaning.</p>

<p>It would seem that the clue to its meaning in this
special sense was first discovered by the late Sir William
(then Mr.) Hardy ("an ingenious and diligent young
man," as he was at the time described) in 1836. He
pointed out that "Dominus Anglie" was the style adopted
by Richard I. "between the demise of his predecessor and
his own coronation."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_223" id="Ref_223" href="#Foot_223">[223]</a></span> Mr. Albert Way, in a valuable
paper on the charters belonging to Reading Abbey, which
appeared some twenty-seven years later,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_224" id="Ref_224" href="#Foot_224">[224]</a></span> called attention
to the styles "Anglorum <i>Regina</i>" and "Anglorum
<i>Domina</i>," as used by the Empress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_225" id="Ref_225" href="#Foot_225">[225]</a></span> As to the former, he
referred to the charter of the Empress at Reading, granting
lands to Reading Abbey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_226" id="Ref_226" href="#Foot_226">[226]</a></span> As to the latter ("Domina
Anglorum"), he quoted Mr. Hardy's paper on the charter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
of Richard I., and urged that "the fact that Matilda was
never crowned Queen of England may suffice to account
for her being thus styled" (p. 283). He further quoted
from William of Malmesbury the two passages in which
that chronicler applies this style to the Empress,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_227" id="Ref_227" href="#Foot_227">[227]</a></span> and he
carefully avoided assigning them both to the episode of the
2nd of March. Lastly, he quoted the third passage, that
in the <i>Gesta Stephani</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. Birch subsequently read a paper "On the Great
Seals of King Stephen" before the Royal Society of
Literature (December 17, 1873), in which he referred to
Mr. Way's paper, as the source of one of the charters
of which he gave the text, and in which he embodied
Mr. Way's observations on the styles "Regina" and
"Domina."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_228" id="Ref_228" href="#Foot_228">[228]</a></span> But instead, unfortunately, of merely following
in Mr. Way's footsteps, he added the startling error
that Stephen was a prisoner, and Matilda consequently
in power, till 1143. He wrote thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Did the king ever cease to exercise his regal functions? Were
these functions performed by any other constitutional sovereign meanwhile?
The events of the year 1141 need not to be very lengthily
discussed to demonstrate that for a brief period there was a break
in Stephen's sovereignty, and a corresponding assumption of royal
power by another ruler unhindered and unimpeached by the lack of
any formality necessary for its full enjoyment.... William
of Malmesbury, writing with all the opportunity of an eye-witness,
and moving in the royal court at the very period, relates at full length
in his <i>Historia Novella</i> (ed. Hardy, for Historical Society, vol. ii.
p. 774<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_229" id="Ref_229" href="#Foot_229">[229]</a></span>), the particulars of the conference held at Winchester subsequent
to the capture of Stephen after the battle of Lincoln, in the
early part of the year, 4 Non. Feb. <small>A.D.</small> 1141.... This election of
Matilda as Domina of England in place of Stephen took place on
Sunday, March 2, 1141.... Until the liberation of the king from his
incarceration at Bristol, as a sequel to the battle at Winchester in
<small>A.D.</small> 1143, so disastrous to the hopes of the Empress, she held her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
position as queen at London. The narrative of the events of this
period, as given by William of Malmesbury in the work already
quoted, so clearly points to her enjoyment of all temporal power
needed to constitute a sovereign, that we must admit her name
among the regnant queens of England" (pp. 12-14).</p>

<p>Two years later (June 9, 1875), Mr. Birch read a
paper before the British Archæological Association,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_230" id="Ref_230" href="#Foot_230">[230]</a></span> in
which, in the same words, he advanced the same thesis.</p>

<p>The following year (June 28, 1876), in an instructive
paper read before the Royal Society of Literature,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_231" id="Ref_231" href="#Foot_231">[231]</a></span> Mr.
Birch wrote thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"As an example of new lights which the study of early English
seals has thus cast upon our history (elucidations, as it were, of facts
which have escaped the keen research of every one of our illustrious
band of historians and chroniclers for upwards of seven hundred
years), an examination into the history of the seal of Mathildis or
Maud, the daughter and heiress of King Henry I. (generally known
as the Empress Maud, or <i>Mathildis Imperatrix</i>, from the fact of her
marriage with the Emperor Henry V. of Germany), has resulted in
my being fortunately enabled to demonstrate that royal lady's
undisputed right to a place in all tables or schemes of sovereigns of
England; nevertheless it is, I believe, a very remarkable fact that her
position with regard to the throne of England should have been so long,
so universally, and so persistently ignored, by all those whose fancy
has led them to accept facts at second hand, or from perfunctory
inquiries into the sources of our national history rather than from
careful step-by-step pursuit of truth through historical tracks which,
like indistinct paths in the primæval forest, often lead the wanderer
into situations which at the outset could not have been foreseen. In
a paper on this subject which I prepared last year, and which is now
published in the <i>Journal of the British Archæological Association</i>, I have
fully explained my views of the propriety of inserting the name of
Mathildis or Maud as Queen of England into the History Tables
under the date of 1141-1143; and as this position has never as yet
been impugned, we may take it that it is right in the main; and
I have shown that until the liberation of King Stephen from his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
imprisonment at Bristol, as a sequel to the battle at Winchester in
1143 (so disastrous to the prospects of Mathildis), she held her position
as queen, most probably at London....</p>

<p class="small">"Now, I have introduced this apparent digression in this place to
point to the importance of the study of historical seals, for my claim
to the restoration of this queen's name is not due so much to my own
researches as it is to the unaccountable oversight of others."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_232" id="Ref_232" href="#Foot_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>I fear that, notwithstanding Mr. Birch's criticism on
all who have gone before him, a careful analysis of the subject
will reveal that the only addition he has made to
our previous knowledge on this subject, as set forth in Mr.
Way's papers, consists in two original and quite incomprehensible
errors: one of them, the assigning of Maud's
election to the episode of the 2nd and 3rd of March,
instead of to that of the 7th and 8th of April (1141); the
other, the assigning of Stephen's liberation to 1143 instead
of 1141. When we correct these two errors, springing
(may we say, in Mr. Birch's words?) "from perfunctory
inquiries into the sources of our national history rather
than from careful step-by-step pursuit of the truth," we
return to the <i>status quo ante</i>, as set forth in Mr. Way's
paper, and find that "the unaccountable oversight," by
all writers before Mr. Birch, of the fact that the Empress
"held her position as queen," for more than two years,
"most probably at London," is due to the fact that her
said rule lasted only a few months, or rather, indeed, a
few weeks, while in London itself it was numbered by days.</p>

<p>But though it has been necessary to speak plainly on
Mr. Birch's unfortunate discovery, one can probably agree
with his acceptance of the view set forth by Mr. Hardy,
and espoused by Mr. Way, that the style "domina"
represents that "dominus" which was used as "a temporary
title for the newly made monarch during the
interval which was elapsing between the death of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
predecessor and the coronation day of the living king."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_233" id="Ref_233" href="#Foot_233">[233]</a></span>
To Mr. Hardy's instance of Richard's style, "Dominus
Angl[iæ]," August, 1189, we may add, I presume, that
of John, "Dominus Angliæ," April 17th and 29th, (1199).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_234" id="Ref_234" href="#Foot_234">[234]</a></span>
Now, if this usage be clearly established, it is certainly
a complete explanation of a style of which historians have
virtually failed to grasp the relevance.</p>

<p>But a really curious parallel, which no one has pointed
out, is that afforded in the reign immediately preceding this,
by the case of the king's second wife. Great importance is
rightly attached to "the election of the Empress as 'domina
Angliæ'" (as Dr. Stubbs describes it<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_235" id="Ref_235" href="#Foot_235">[235]</a></span>), and to the words
which William of Malmesbury places in the legate's
mouth;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_236" id="Ref_236" href="#Foot_236">[236]</a></span> and yet, though the fact is utterly ignored, the
very same formula of election is used in the case of Queen
"Adeliza," twenty years before (1121)!</p>

<p>The expression there used by the Continuator is
this: "Puella prædicta, <i>in regni dominam electa</i>, ... regi
desponsatur" (ii. 75). That is to say that before her
marriage (January 29) and formal coronation as queen
(January 30) she was elected, it would seem, "Domina
Angliæ." The phrase "in regni dominam electa" precisely
describes the <i>status</i> of the Empress after her election at
Winchester, and before that formal coronation at Westminster
which, as I maintain, was fully intended to follow.
We might even go further still, and hold that the description
of Adeliza as "futuram regni dominam,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_237" id="Ref_237" href="#Foot_237">[237]</a></span> when the
envoys were despatched to fetch her, implies that she had
been so elected at that great Epiphany council, in which
the king "decrevit sibi in uxorem Atheleidem."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_238" id="Ref_238" href="#Foot_238">[238]</a></span> But I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
do not wish to press the parallel too far. In any case,
precisely as with the Empress afterwards, she was clearly
"domina Angliæ" before she was crowned queen. And,
if "electa" means elected, the fact that these two
passages, referring to the two elections (1121 and 1141),
come from two independent chronicles proves that the
terms employed are no idiosyncracy, but refer to a
recognized practice of the highest constitutional interest.</p>

<p>Of course the fact that the same expression is applied
to the election of Queen "Adeliza" as to that of the Empress
herself, detracts from the importance of the latter event,
regarded as an election to the throne.</p>

<p>At the same time, I hold that we should remember, as
in the case of Stephen, the feudal bearing of "dominus." For
herein lies its difference from "Rex." The "dominatus" of
the Empress over England is attained step by step.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_239" id="Ref_239" href="#Foot_239">[239]</a></span> At
Cirencester, at Winchester, at Oxford, she becomes
"domina" in turn.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_240" id="Ref_240" href="#Foot_240">[240]</a></span> Not so with the royal title. She
could be "lady" of a city or of a man: she could be
"queen" of nothing less than England.</p>

<p>I must, however, with deep regret, differ widely from
Mr. Birch in his conclusions on the styles adopted by the
Empress. These he classes under three heads.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_241" id="Ref_241" href="#Foot_241">[241]</a></span> The
second ("Mathildis Imperatrix Henrici regis filia et
Anglorum regina") is found in only two charters, which
I agree with him in assigning "to periods closely consecutive,"
not indeed to the episode of March 2 and 3, but
to that of April 7 and 8. Of his remaining twenty-seven
charters, thirteen belong to his first class and fourteen to
his third, a proportion which makes it hard to understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
why he should speak of the latter as "by far the most
frequent."</p>

<p>Of the first class ("Mathildis Imperatrix Henrici
Regis filia") Mr. Birch writes:—</p>

<p class="small">"It is most probable that these documents are to be assigned to
a period either before the death of her father, King Henry I., or at most
to the initial years of Stephen, before any serious attempt had been
made to obtain the possession of the kingdom."</p>

<p>Now, it is absolutely certain that not a single one of
them can be assigned to the period suggested, that not one
of them is previous to that 2nd of March (1141) which
Mr. Birch selects as his turning-point, still less to "the
death of her father" (1135). Nay, on Mr. Birch's own
showing, the first and most important of these documents
should be dated "between the 3rd of March and the 24th
of July, <small>A.D.</small> 1141" (p. 380), and two others (Nos. 21, 28)
"must be ascribed to a date between 1149 and 1151"
(p. 397 <i>n.</i>). Nor is even this all, for as in two others the
son of the Empress is spoken of as "King Henry," they
must be as late as the reign of Henry II.</p>

<p>So, also, with the third class ("Mathildis Imperatrix
Henrici regis filia et Anglorum domina"), of which we are
told that it—</p>

<p class="small">"was in the first instance adopted—I mean used—in those charters
which contain the word and were promulgated between <small>A.D.</small> 1135 and
<small>A.D.</small> 1141, by reason of the ceremony of coronation not yet having been
performed; and with regard to those charters which are placed subsequent
to <small>A.D.</small> 1141, either because the ceremony was still unperformed,
although she had the possession of the crown, or because of some
stipulation with her opponents in power" (p. 383).</p>

<p>Here, again, it is absolutely certain that not a single
one of these charters was "promulgated between <small>A.D.</small> 1135
and <small>A.D.</small> 1141." We have, therefore, no evidence that the
Empress, in her charters, adopted this style until the
election of April 7 and 8 (1141) enabled her justly to do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
so. But the fact is that Mr. Birch's theory is not only
based, as we have seen, on demonstrably erroneous
hypotheses, but must be altogether abandoned as opposed
to every fact of the case. For the two styles which he
thus distinguishes were used at the same time, and even
in the same document. For instance, in the very first of
Mr. Birch's documents, that great charter to Geoffrey de
Mandeville, to which we shall come, in the next chapter,
issued at the height of Matilda's power, and on the eve,
as we shall see, of her intended coronation, "Anglorum
domina" is omitted from her style, and the document is
therefore, by Mr. Birch, assigned to the first of his classes.
Yet I shall show that in a portion of the charter which has
perished, and which is therefore unknown to Mr. Birch,
her style is immediately repeated with the addition
"Anglorum Domina." It is clear, then, on Mr. Birch's
own showing, that this document should be assigned both
to his first and to his third classes, and, consequently, that
the distinction he attempts to draw has no foundation in fact.</p>

<p>Mr. Birch's thesis would, if sound, be a discovery of
such importance that I need not apologize for establishing,
by demonstration, that it is opposed to the whole of the
evidence which he himself so carefully collected. And
when we read of Stephen's "incarceration at Bristol,
which was not terminated until the battle of Winchester
in <small>A.D.</small> 1143, when the hopes of the Empress were shattered"
(p. 378), it is again necessary to point out that her flight
from Winchester took place not in 1143, but in September,
1141. Mr. Birch's conclusion is thus expressed:—</p>

<p class="small">"We may, therefore, take it as fairly shown that until the liberation
of the king from his imprisonment at Bristol (as a sequel to the
battle at Winchester in <small>A.D.</small> 1143, so disastrous to the queen's hopes)
she held her position, as queen, most probably at London," etc.
(p. 380).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
Here, as before, it is needful to remember that the date
is all wrong, and that the triumph of the Empress, so far
from lasting two years or more, lasted but for a few months
of the year 1141, in the course of which she was not at
London for more than a few days.</p>

<p>And now let us turn to my remaining point, "the effect
of this election on the position of the Empress."</p>

<p>To understand this, we must glance back at the
precedents of the four preceding reigns. The Empress,
as I have shown, had followed these precedents in making
first for Winchester: she had still to follow them in
securing her coronation and anointing at Westminster.
It is passing strange that all historians should have lost
sight of this circumstance. For the case of her own father,
in whose shoes she claimed to stand, was the aptest
precedent of all. As he had been elected at Winchester,
and then crowned at Westminster, so would she, following
in his footsteps. The growing importance of London had
been recognized in successive coronations from the Conquest,
and now that it was rapidly supplanting Winchester
as the destined capital of the realm, it would be more
essential than ever that the coronation should there take
place, and secure not merely the <i>prestige</i> of tradition, but
the assent of the citizens of London.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_242" id="Ref_242" href="#Foot_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>It has not, however, so far as I know, occurred to any
writer that it was the full intention of the Empress and
her followers that she should be crowned and anointed
queen, and that, like those who had gone before her, she
should be so crowned at Westminster. It is because they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
failed to grasp this that Dr. Stubbs and Mr. Freeman are
both at fault. The former writes:—</p>

<p class="small">"Matilda became the Lady of the English; she was not crowned,
because perhaps the solemn consecration which she had received as
empress sufficed, or perhaps Stephen's royalty was so far forth indefeasible."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_243" id="Ref_243" href="#Foot_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p class="small">"No attempt was made to crown the Empress; the legate simply
proposes that she should be elected Lady of England and Normandy.
It is just possible that the consecration which she had once received
as empress might be regarded as superseding the necessity of a new
ceremony of the kind, but it is far more likely that, so long as Stephen
was alive and not formally degraded, the right conferred on him by
coronation was regarded as so far indefeasible that no one else could
be allowed to share it."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_244" id="Ref_244" href="#Foot_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Stubbs appears here to imply that we should have
expected her coronation to follow her election. And in
this he is clearly right. Mr. Freeman, however, oddly
enough, seems to have looked for it <i>before</i> her election.
This is the more strange in a champion of the elective
principle. He writes thus of her reception at Winchester,
five weeks before her election:—</p>

<p class="small">"If Matilda was to reign, her reign needed to begin by something
which might pass for an election and coronation. But her followers,
Bishop Henry at their head, seem to have shrunk from the actual
crowning and anointing ceremonies, which—unless Sexburh had, ages
before, received the royal consecration—had never, either in England
or in Gaul, been applied to a female ruler. Matilda was solemnly
received in the cathedral church of Winchester; she was led by two
bishops, the legate himself and Bernard of St. David's, as though to
receive the crown and unction, but no crowning and no unction is
spoken of."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_245" id="Ref_245" href="#Foot_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
At the same time, he recurs to the subject, after
describing the election, thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Whether any consecration was designed to follow, whether at
such consecration she would have been promoted to the specially
royal title, we are not told."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_246" id="Ref_246" href="#Foot_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>But all this uncertainty is at once dispelled when we
learn what was really intended. Taken in conjunction
with the essential fact that "domina" possessed the
special sense of the interim royal title, the intention of
the Empress to be crowned at Westminster, and so to
become queen in name as well as queen in deed, gives us
the key to the whole problem. It explains, moreover,
the full meaning of John of Hexham's words, when he
writes that "David rex videns multa competere in imperatricis
neptis suæ promotionem post Ascensionem Domini
(May 8) ad eam in Suth-Anglia profectus est ... plurimosque
ex principibus sibi acquiescentes habuit ut ipsa
promoveretur ad totius regni fastigium." We shall see
how this intention was only foiled by the sudden uprising
of the citizens; and in the names of the witnesses to
Geoffrey's charter we shall behold those, "tam episcopi
quam cinguli militaris viri, qui <i>ad dominam inthronizandam</i>
pomposé Londonias et arroganter convenerant."<span class="fnanchor"><a

afforded by the customs of Bigorre, as recorded (it is alleged) in 1097, is so
striking as to deserve being quoted here. Speaking of the reception of a
new lord, they provide that "antequam habitatorum terræ fidejussores

As an instance of the crown being kept at Winchester, take the entry in
the Pipe-Roll of 4 Hen. II.: "In conducendis coronis Regis ad Wirecestre de
Wintoniâ," the crowns being taken out to be worn at Worcester, Easter, 1158.
Oddly enough, Mr. Freeman himself alludes, in its place, to a similar taking
out of the crown, from the treasury at Winchester, to be worn at York,
Christmas, 1069. The words of Ordericus, as quoted by him, are: "Guillelmus
ex civitate Guentâ jubet adferri coronam, aliaque ornamenta regalia et
vasa" (cf. <i>Dialogus</i>, I. 14).</p>

To this visit (if the only occasion on which she was at Winchester in
the spring) must belong the Empress's charter to Thurstan de Montfort.
As it is not comprised in Mr. Birch's collection, I subjoin it <i>in extenso</i>
(from Dugdale's MSS.):—</p>

<p class="nodent">"M. Imperatrix H. Regis filia Rogero Comiti de Warwick et omnibus
fidelibus suis Francis et Anglis de Warewicscire salutem. Sciatis me
concessisse Thurstino de Monteforti quod habeat mercatum die dominica ad
castellum suum de Bellodeserto. Volo igitur et firmiter præcipio quatenus
omnes euntes, et stantes, et redeuntes de Mercato prædicto habeant firmam
pacem. T. Milone de Glocestria. Apud Wintoniam."</p>

<p class="nodent">As Milo attests not as an earl, this charter cannot belong to the subsequent
visit to Winchester in the summer. The author of the Gesta mentions
the Earl of Warwick among those who joined the Empress at once "sponte
nulloque cogente."</p>

Relying on the explicit statement of the chronicler (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, p.
732), that the Earl of Gloucester "fratrem etiam suum Reinaldum in tanta
difficultate temporis comitem Cornubiæ creavit," historians and antiquaries
have assigned this creation to 1140 (see Stubbs' <i>Const. Hist.</i>, i. 362, <i>n.</i>; Courthope's
<i>Historic Peerage</i>; Doyle's <i>Official Baronage</i>). In the version of
Reginald's success given by the author of the <i>Gesta</i>, there is no mention of
this creation, but that may, of course, be rejected as merely negative evidence.
The above charter, however, certainly raises the question whether
he had indeed been created earl at the time when he thus attested it. The
point may be deemed of some importance as involving the question whether
the Empress did really create an earl before the triumph of her cause.</p>

"Concilium archiepiscopi Cantuariæ Thedbaldi, et omnium episcoporum
Angliæ" (p. 744). Strange to say, Professor Pearson (I. 478) states that
"Theobald remained faithful" to Stephen, though he had now formally
joined the Empress. On the other hand, "Stephen's queen and William of
Ypres" are represented by him as present, though they were far away,
preparing for resistance. An important allusion to the primate's conduct
at this time is found (under 1148) in the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i> (Pertz's <i>Monumenta
Historica</i>, vol. xx.), where we read "propter obedienciam sedis
apostolicæ proscriptus fuerat, quando urgente mandato domni Henrici Wintoniensis

It is very singular that Mr. Freeman failed to perceive this parallel,
since he himself writes of Henry (1100). "The Gemót of election was held
at Winchester while the precedents of three reigns made it seem matter
of necessity that the unction and coronation should be done at Westminster"
(<i>Will. Rufus</i>, ii. 348). Such an admission as this is sufficient to prove
my case.</p>

<i>Norm. Conq.</i>, v. 303, 304. The footnote to this statement ("William of
Malmesbury seems distinctly to exclude a coronation," etc., etc.) has been
already given (<i>ante</i>, p. 62). Mr. Birch confusing, as we have seen, the reception
of the Empress with her election, naturally looks, like Mr. Freeman, to the
former as the time when she ought to have been crowned: "The crown of
England's sovereigns was handed over to her, a kind of <i>seizin</i> representing
that the kingdom of England was under the power of her hands (although
it does not appear that any further ceremony connected with the rite of
coronation was then performed)" (<i>Journ. B. A. A.</i>, xxxi. p. 378). This assumes
that the crown was "handed over to her" at a "ceremony" in the
cathedral, whereas, as I explained, my own view is that she obtained it
with the royal castle.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>THE FIRST CHARTER OF THE EMPRESS.</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Though</span>
the election of the Empress, says William of
Malmesbury, took place immediately after Easter, it was
nearly midsummer before the Londoners would receive
her.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_248" id="Ref_248" href="#Foot_248">[248]</a></span>
Hence her otherwise strange delay in proceeding to
the scene of her coronation. An incidental allusion leads
us to believe that this <i>interregnum</i> was marked by tumult
and bloodshed in London. We learn that Aubrey de Vere
was killed on the 9th of May, in the course of a riot in the
city.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_249" id="Ref_249" href="#Foot_249">[249]</a></span> This event has been assigned by every writer that
I have consulted to the May of the previous year (1140),
and this is the date assigned in the editor's marginal
note.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_250" id="Ref_250" href="#Foot_250">[250]</a></span> The context, however, clearly shows that it belongs
to 1141. Aubrey was a man of some consequence. He
had been actively employed by Henry I. in the capacity
of justice and of sheriff, and was also a royal chamberlain.
His death, therefore, was a notable event, and one is
tempted to associate with it the fact that he was father-in-law
to Geoffrey. It is not impossible that, on that
occasion, they may have been acting in concert, and
resisting a popular movement of the citizens, whether
directed against the Empress or against Geoffrey himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
The comparison of the Empress's advance on London
with that of her grandfather, in similar circumstances, is
of course obvious. The details, however, of the latter are
obscure, and Mr. Parker, we must remember, has gravely
impugned the account of it given in the <i>Norman Conquest</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_251" id="Ref_251" href="#Foot_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the ten weeks which appear to have elapsed between
the election of the Empress and her reception in London,
we know little or nothing. Early in May she came to
Reading,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_252" id="Ref_252" href="#Foot_252">[252]</a></span> the Continuator's statement to that effect being
confirmed by a charter which, to all appearance, passed
on this occasion.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_253" id="Ref_253" href="#Foot_253">[253]</a></span> It is attested by her three constant
companions, the Earl of Gloucester, Brian fitz Count,
and Miles of Gloucester (acting as her constable), together
with John (fitz Gilbert) the marshal, and her brothers
Reginald (now an earl)<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_254" id="Ref_254" href="#Foot_254">[254]</a></span> and
Robert (fitz Edith).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_255" id="Ref_255" href="#Foot_255">[255]</a></span> But a
special significance is to be found in the names of the five
attesting bishops (Winchester, Lincoln, Ely, St. David's,
and Hereford). They are, it will be found, the same five
who attest the charter to Geoffrey de Mandeville (midsummer),
and they are also the five who (with the Bishop
of Bath) had attended, in March, the Empress at Winchester.
This creates a strong presumption that, in despite
of chroniclers' vague assertions, the number of bishops
who joined the Empress was, even if not limited to these,
at least extremely small.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_256" id="Ref_256" href="#Foot_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
This is one of the two charters in which the Empress
employs the style "Regina." It is probable that the
other also should be assigned to this period.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_257" id="Ref_257" href="#Foot_257">[257]</a></span> These two
exceptional cases would thus belong to the interim period
during which she was queen elect, though technically only
"domina." Here again the fact that, during this period,
she adopted, alternatively, both styles ("regina" and
"domina"), as well as that which Mr. Birch assigns to
his first period, proves how impossible it is to classify
these styles by date.</p>

<p>If we reject the statement that from Reading she
returned to Oxford,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_258" id="Ref_258" href="#Foot_258">[258]</a></span> the only other stage in her progress
that is named is that of her reception at St. Albans.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_259" id="Ref_259" href="#Foot_259">[259]</a></span> In
this case also the evidence of a charter confirms that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
the chronicler.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_260" id="Ref_260" href="#Foot_260">[260]</a></span> At St. Albans she received a deputation
from London, and the terms on which the city agreed to
receive her must have been here finally arranged.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_261" id="Ref_261" href="#Foot_261">[261]</a></span> She
then proceeded in state to Westminster,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_262" id="Ref_262" href="#Foot_262">[262]</a></span> no doubt by the
Edgware Road, the old Roman highway, and was probably
met by the citizens and their rulers, according to the
custom, at Knightsbridge.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_263" id="Ref_263" href="#Foot_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, she had been joined in her progress by
her uncle, the King of Scots, who had left his realm about
the middle of May for the purpose of attending her
coronation.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_264" id="Ref_264" href="#Foot_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>The Empress, according to William of Malmesbury,
reached London only a few days before the 24th of June.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_265" id="Ref_265" href="#Foot_265">[265]</a></span>
This is the sole authority we have for the date of her visit,
except the statement by Trivet that she arrived on the
21st (or 26th) of April.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_266" id="Ref_266" href="#Foot_266">[266]</a></span> This latter date we may certainly
reject. If we combine the statement that her flight took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
place on Midsummer Day<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_267" id="Ref_267" href="#Foot_267">[267]</a></span> with that of the Continuator
that her visit lasted for "some days,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_268" id="Ref_268" href="#Foot_268">[268]</a></span> they harmonize
fairly enough with that of William of Malmesbury. If it
was, indeed, after a few days that her visit was so rudely
cut short, we are able to understand why she left without
the intended coronation taking place.</p>

<p>From another and quite independent authority, we
obtain the same day (June 24th) as the date of her flight
from London, together with a welcome and important
glimpse of her doings. The would-be Bishop of Durham,
William Cumin, had come south with the King of Scots
(whose chancellor he was), accompanied by certain barons
of the bishopric and a deputation from the cathedral
chapter. Nominally, this deputation was to claim from
the Empress and the legate a confirmation of the chapter's
canonical right of free election; but, in fact, it was composed
of William's adherents, who purposed to secure from
the Empress and the legate letters to the chapter in his
favour. The legate not having arrived at court when
they reached the Empress, she deferred her reply till he
should join her. In the result, however, the two differed;
for, while the legate, warned from Durham, refused to
support William, the Empress, doubtless influenced by
her uncle, had actually agreed, as sovereign, to give him
the ring and staff, and would undoubtedly have done so,
but for the Londoners' revolt.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_269" id="Ref_269" href="#Foot_269">[269]</a></span> It must be remembered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
that, for her own sake, the Empress would welcome every
opportunity of exercising sovereign rights, as in her
prompt bestowal of the see of London upon Robert. And
though she lost her chance of actually investing William,
she had granted, before her flight, letters commending him
for election.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_270" id="Ref_270" href="#Foot_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we obtain the date of the charter which is the
subject of this chapter. In this case alone was Mr. Eyton
right in the dates he assigned to these documents. Nor,
indeed, is it possible to be mistaken. For this charter can
only have passed on the occasion of this, the only visit
that the Empress paid to Westminster. Yet, even here, Mr.
Eyton's date is not absolutely correct. For he holds that
it "passed in the short period during which Maud was in
London, <i>i.e.</i> between June 24 and July 25, 1141";<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_271" id="Ref_271" href="#Foot_271">[271]</a></span> whereas
"June 24" is the probable date of her departure, and
not of her arrival, which was certainly previous to that
day.</p>

<p>There is but one other document (besides a comparatively
insignificant precept<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_272" id="Ref_272" href="#Foot_272">[272]</a></span>) which can be positively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
assigned to this visit.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_273" id="Ref_273" href="#Foot_273">[273]</a></span> This consideration alone would
invest our charter with interest, but when we add to this
its great length, its list of witnesses, and its intrinsic
importance, it may be claimed as one of the most instructive
documents of this obscure and eventful period.</p>

<p>Of the original, now among the Cottonian Charters
(xvi. 27), Mr. Birch, who is exceptionally qualified to pronounce
upon these subjects, has given us as complete a
transcript as it is now possible to obtain.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_274" id="Ref_274" href="#Foot_274">[274]</a></span> To this he has
appended the following remarks:—</p>

<p class="small">"This most important charter, one of the earliest, if not the
earliest example of the text of a deed creating a peerage, does not
appear to have been ever published. I cannot find the text in any printed
book or MS. Fortunately Sir William Dugdale inspected this
charter before it had been injured in the disastrous Cottonian fire,
which destroyed so many invaluable evidences of British history. In
his account of the Mandevilles, Earls of Essex (<i>Baronage</i>, vol. i. p. 202)
he says that 'this is the most antient creation-charter, which hath ever
been known, <i>vide</i> Selden's <i>Titles of Honour</i>, p. 647,' and he gives an
English rendering of the greater portion of the Latin text, which has
enabled me to conjecture several emendations and restorations in the
above transcript."</p>

<p>Mr. Birch having thus, like preceding antiquaries,
borne witness to the interest attaching to "this most
important charter," it is with special satisfaction that I
find myself enabled to print a transcript of the entire
document, supplying, there is every reason to believe, a
complete and accurate text. Nor will it only enable us
to restore the portions of the charter now wanting,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_275" id="Ref_275" href="#Foot_275">[275]</a></span> for it
further convicts the great Dugdale of no less serious an
error than the omission of two most important witnesses
and the garbling of the name of a third.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_276" id="Ref_276" href="#Foot_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
The accuracy of my authorities can be tested by collation
with those portions of the original that are still perfect.
This test is quite satisfactory, as is also that of comparing
one of the passages they supply with Camden's transcript
of that same passage, taken from the original charter.
Camden's extract, of the existence of which Mr. Birch was
evidently not aware, was printed by him in his <i>Ordines
Anglicani</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_277" id="Ref_277" href="#Foot_277">[277]</a></span> from which it is quoted by Selden in his well-known
<i>Titles of Honour</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_278" id="Ref_278" href="#Foot_278">[278]</a></span> It is further quoted, as from
Camden and Selden, at the head of the Patents of Creation
appended to the <i>Lords' Reports on the Dignity of a Peer</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_279" id="Ref_279" href="#Foot_279">[279]</a></span>
as also in the Third Report itself (where the marginal
reference, however, is wrong).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_280" id="Ref_280" href="#Foot_280">[280]</a></span> It is specially interesting
from Camden's comment: "This is the most ancient
creation-charter that I ever saw" (which is clearly the
origin of the statement as to its unique antiquity), and
from the fact of that great antiquary speaking of it as
"now in my hands."</p>

<p>The two transcripts I have employed for the text (D.
and A.) are copies respectively found in the Dugdale MSS.
(L. fol. 81) and the Ashmole MSS. (841, fol. 3). I have
reason to believe that this charter was among those duly
recorded in the missing volume of the Great Coucher.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">One cannot but be greatly struck by the names of the
witnesses to this charter. The legate and his four brother
prelates, who had been with the Empress in Winchester, at
her reception on March 3, are here with her again at Westminster.
So are her three inseparable companions; but
where are the magnates of England? Two west-country
earls, one of them of her own making,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_318" id="Ref_318" href="#Foot_318">[318]</a></span> and a few west-country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
barons virtually complete the list. I do not say
that these were, of necessity, the sole constituents of her
court; but there is certainly the strongest possible presumption
that had she been joined in person by any number of
bishops or nobles, we should not have found so important
a charter witnessed merely by the members of the <i>entourage</i>
that she had brought up with her from the west. We
have, for instance, but to compare this list with that of
the witnesses to Stephen's charter six months later.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_319" id="Ref_319" href="#Foot_319">[319]</a></span> Or,
indeed, we may compare it, to some disadvantage, with
that of the Empress herself a month later at Oxford.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_320" id="Ref_320" href="#Foot_320">[320]</a></span>
Where were the primate and the Bishop of London?
Where was the King of Scots? These questions are
difficult to answer. It may, however, be suggested that
the general disgust at her intolerable arrogance,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_321" id="Ref_321" href="#Foot_321">[321]</a></span> and her
harshness to the king,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_322" id="Ref_322" href="#Foot_322">[322]</a></span> kept the magnates from attending
her court.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_323" id="Ref_323" href="#Foot_323">[323]</a></span> Her inability to repel the queen's forces, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
her instant flight before the Londoners, are alike suggestive
of the fact that her followers were comparatively few.</p>

<p>There are several points of constitutional importance
upon which this instructive charter sheds some welcome
light.</p>

<p>In the first place we should compare it with Stephen's
charter (p. 51), to which, in Mr. Eyton's words, it forms
the "counter-patent."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_324" id="Ref_324" href="#Foot_324">[324]</a></span> In the former the words of
creation are: "Sciatis me fecisse comitem de Gaufredo,"
etc. In the charter of the Empress they run thus:
"Sciatis ... quod ... do et concedo Gaufredo de Magnavilla
... ut sit Comes," etc. This contrast is in itself
conclusive as to the earldom having been first <i>created</i> by
Stephen and then <i>recognized</i> by the Empress. This being
so, it is the more strange that Mr. Eyton should have
arrived at the contrary conclusion, especially as he noticed
the stronger form in the charter creating the earldom of
Hereford ("Sciatis me fecisse Milonem de Glocestriâ Comitem"),
a form corresponding with that in Stephen's
charter to Geoffrey. The earldom of Hereford being
<i>created</i> by the Empress, as that of Essex had been by
Stephen, we find the same formula duly employed by both.
The distinction thus established is one of considerable
importance.</p>

<p>The special grant of the "tertius denarius" is a point
of such extreme interest in its bearing on earls and
earldoms that it requires to be separately discussed in a
note devoted to the subject.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_325" id="Ref_325" href="#Foot_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>But without dwelling at greater length upon the peerage
aspect of this charter, let us see how it illustrates the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
ambitious policy pursued in this struggle by the feudal
nobles. Dr. Stubbs writes:—</p>

<p class="small">"It is possible that the frequent tergiversations which mark the
struggle may have been caused by the desire of obtaining confirmation
of the rank [of earl] from both the competitors for the crown."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_326" id="Ref_326" href="#Foot_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>But it is my contention that Geoffrey and his fellows
were playing a deeper game. We find each successive
change of side on the part of this unscrupulous magnate
marked by a distinct advance in his demands and in the
price he obtained. Broadly speaking, he was master of
the situation, and he put himself and his fortress up to
auction. Thus he obtained from the impassioned rivals
a rapid advance at each bid. Compare, for instance, this
charter with that he had obtained from Stephen, or,
again, compare it with those which are to follow.</p>

<p>The very length of this charter, as compared with
Stephen's, is significant enough in itself. But its details
are far more so. Stephen's grant had not explicitly
included the <i>tertius denarius</i>; the Empress grants him the
<i>tertius denarius</i> "sicut comes habere debet in comitatu
suo."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_327" id="Ref_327" href="#Foot_327">[327]</a></span> But what may be termed the characteristic
features are to be found in such clauses as those dealing
with the license to fortify, and with the grants of lands.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_328" id="Ref_328" href="#Foot_328">[328]</a></span>
These latter, indeed, teem with information, not only for
the local, but for the general historian, as in the case of
Theobald's forfeiture. But their special information is
rather in the light they throw on the nature of these grants,
and on the sources from which the Empress, like her rival,
strove to gratify the greed of these insatiable nobles.</p>

<p>Foremost among these were those "extravagant grants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
of Crown lands" spoken of by Dr. Stubbs and by Gneist.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_329" id="Ref_329" href="#Foot_329">[329]</a></span>
Now, in this charter, and in those which follow, we are
enabled to trace the actual working of this fatal policy in
practice. The Empress begins, in this charter, by granting
Geoffrey, for this is its effect, £100 a year in land
("C libratas terræ"). Stephen, we shall find, a few
months later, regains him to his side by increasing the
bid to £300 a year ("CCC libratas terræ"). But how is the
amount made up? It is charged on the Crown lands in
his own county of Essex. But observe, for this is an
important point, that it is not charged as a lump sum on
the entire <i>corpus comitatus</i> (or, to speak more exactly, on
the annual <i>firma</i> of that <i>corpus</i>), but on certain specified
estates. Here we have a welcome allusion to the practice
of the early Exchequer. The charter authorizes Geoffrey,
as sheriff, to deduct from the annual ferm of the county,
for which he was responsible at the Exchequer (being that
recorded on the <i>Rotulus exactorius</i>), that portion of it
represented by the annual rents (<i>redditus</i>) of Maldon and
Newport, which, as estates of Crown demesne, had till
then been included in the <i>corpus</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_330" id="Ref_330" href="#Foot_330">[330]</a></span> From the earliest
Pipe-Rolls now remaining we know that the estates so
alienated were usually entered by the sheriff under the
head of "<i>Terræ Datæ</i>," with the amount due from each,
for which amounts, of course, he claimed allowance in his
account. I think we have here at least a suggestion that
even at the height of the anarchy and of the struggle,
the Exchequer, with all the details of its practice, was
recognized as in full existence. I have never been able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
to reconcile myself to the accepted view, as set forth by
Dr. Stubbs, of the "stoppage of the administrative
machinery"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_331" id="Ref_331" href="#Foot_331">[331]</a></span> under Stephen. He holds that on the arrest
of the bishops (June, 1139) "the whole administration
of the country ceased to work," and that Stephen was
"never able to restore the administrative machinery."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_332" id="Ref_332" href="#Foot_332">[332]</a></span>
Crippled and disorganized though it doubtless was, the
Exchequer, I contend, must have preserved its existence,
because its existence was an absolute necessity. Without
an exchequer, the income of the Crown would, obviously,
have instantly disappeared. Moreover, the case of
William of Ypres, and others to which reference will be
made below, will go far to establish the important fact
that the Exchequer system remained in force, and that
accounts of some kind must have been kept.</p>

<p>The next point to which I would call attention is the
expression "pro tanto quantum inde reddi solebat die quâ
Rex Henricus fuit vivus et mortuus," which is applied
to Maldon and Newport. The Pipe-Rolls, it should be
remembered, only took cognizance of the total ferm of
the shire. The constituents of that ferm were a matter
for the sheriff. At first sight, therefore, these expressions
might seem to cause some difficulty. Their explanation,
however, is this. Just as I have shown in <i>Domesday
Studies</i><span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_333" id="Ref_333" href="#Foot_333">[333]</a></span> that the ferm of a town, as in the case of Huntingdon,
was in truth the aggregate of several distinct and
separate ferms, so the ferm of a county must have comprised
the separate and distinct ferms of each of the royal
estates. That ferm would be a customary, that is, fixed,
<i>redditus</i> (or, as the charter expresses it, "quantum inde
reddi solebat"). A particularly striking case in point is
afforded by Hatfield Regis (<i>alias</i> Hatfield Broadoak).
When Stephen increased the alienation of Crown demesne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
to Geoffrey, he granted him Hatfield <i>inter alia</i> "pro
quater xx libris," that is, as representing £80 a year.
This same estate, after the fall of Geoffrey, was alienated
anew to Richard de Luci, and in the early Pipe-Rolls of
Henry II. we read, under "Terræ Datæ" in Essex,
"Ricardo de Luci quater xx libræ numero in Hadfeld."
That is to say, in his annual account, the sheriff claimed
to be allowed £80 off the amount of his ferm, in respect
of the alienated estate. Now, the Domesday valuation of
this manor is fortunately very precise: "Tunc Manerium
valuit xxxvi libras. Modo lx. Sed vicecomes recipit inde
lxxx libras et c solidos de gersuma" (ii. 2 b). The
Domesday <i>redditus</i> of the manor, therefore, had remained
absolutely unchanged. In such cases of alienation of
demesne, it was, obviously, the object of the grantee that
the manor should be valued as low as possible, while that
of the sheriff was precisely the reverse. It was on this
account doubtless, to prevent dispute, that these charters
carefully named the sum at which the manor was to be
valued, either in figures, as in the case of Bonhunt,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_334" id="Ref_334" href="#Foot_334">[334]</a></span> or, as
in that of Maldon and Newport, in the formula "quantum
inde reddi solebat" at the death of Henry I., this formula
probably implying that the earlier ferm had been
forced up in the days of the Lion of Justice.</p>

<p>The conclusion I would draw from the above argument
is that the sheriff was not at liberty to exact arbitrary
sums from the demesne lands of the Crown. A fixed
annual render (<i>redditus</i>) was due to him from each, though
this, like the <i>firma</i> of the sheriff himself, was liable to
revision from time to time.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_335" id="Ref_335" href="#Foot_335">[335]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
But it would be difficult to overestimate the importance
of evidence which forms a connecting link between Domesday
and the period of the Pipe-Rolls, especially if it throws
some fresh light on the vexed question of Domesday
values. Moreover, we have here an obvious suggestion as
to the purpose of the Conqueror in ascertaining values, at
least so far as concerned the demesne lands of the Crown,
for he was thus enabled to check the sheriffs, by obtaining
a basis for calculating the amount of the <i>firma comitatus</i>.
With this point we shall have to deal when we come to
Geoffrey's connection with the shrievalty of Essex and
Herts.</p>

<p>Attention may also be called to the formula of
"excambion" (as the Scottish lawyers term it) here
employed, for it would seem to be earlier than any of
those quoted in Madox's <i>Formularium</i>. But the suggested
exchange is specially interesting in the case of Count
Theobald, because it gives us an historical fact not elsewhere
mentioned, namely, that the Empress, on obtaining
the mastery, forfeited his lands at once. Her doing
so, we should observe, is in strict accordance with the
chroniclers' assertions as to her wholesale forfeitures and
her special hostility to Stephen's house. And we can go
further still. We can ascertain not only that Count
Theobald was forfeited, as we have seen, by the Empress,
but also that the land she forfeited had been given him
by Stephen himself. In a document which I have
previously referred to, we read that Stephen had given
him the "manor" of Maldon,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_336" id="Ref_336" href="#Foot_336">[336]</a></span> being that manor of Crown
demesne which the Empress here bestows upon Geoffrey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">{103}</a></span>
Another important though difficult subject upon which
this charter bears is that of knight-service. Indeed,
considering its early date—a quarter of a century earlier
than the returns contained in the <i>Liber Niger</i>—it may,
in conjunction with Stephen's charter of some six
months later, be pronounced to be among our most
valuable evidences for what Dr. Stubbs describes as "a
subject on which the greatest obscurity prevails."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_337" id="Ref_337" href="#Foot_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us first notice that the Empress grants "feodum
et servicium <small>XX</small> militum," while Stephen grants "<small>LX</small>
milites feudatos ... scilicet servicium" of so and so
"pro [<small>LX</small>] militibus." Thus, then, the "milites feudatos"
of Stephen equates the "feodum et servicium ... militum"
of the Empress. And, further, it repeats the
remarkable expression employed by Florence of Worcester
when he tells us that the Conqueror instructed the Domesday
Commissioners to ascertain "quot milites feudatos"
his tenants-in-chief possessed, that is to say, how many
knights they had enfeoffed. But the Empress in her
charter complicates her grant by adding the special
clause: "Et servicium istorum <small>XX</small> militum faciet mihi
separatim preter aliud servicium alterius feodi sui."
Had it not been for this clause, one might have inferred
that the object of the grant was to transfer, to Earl
Geoffrey the "servicium" of these twenty knights' fees
due, of right, to the Crown, so that he might enjoy all
such profits as the Crown would have derived from that
"servicium," and, at the same time, have employed these
knights as substitutes for those which he was bound to
furnish, from his own fief, to the Crown. But the above
clause is fatal to such a view. Again, both in the charters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
of the Empress and of her rival, these special grants of
knights and their "servicium" are kept entirely distinct
from those of Crown demesne or escheated land, which,
moreover, are expressed in terms of the "librata terræ."
On the whole I lean strongly to the belief that, although
the working of the arrangement may be obscure, the
object of Geoffrey was to add to the number of the knights
who followed his standard, and thus to increase his power
as a noble and the weight that he could throw into the
scale. And the special clause referred to above would
imply that the Crown was to have a claim on him for
twenty knights more than those whom he was bound to
furnish from his own fief.</p>

<p>Lastly, we may note the identity of the formula
employed for the grant of lands and for that of knights'
service. In each case the grant is made "pro tanto,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_338" id="Ref_338" href="#Foot_338">[338]</a></span>
and in each case the Empress undertakes to make good
("perficere") the balance to him within the limit of the
three counties of Essex, Cambridgeshire, and Herts.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_339" id="Ref_339" href="#Foot_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>With the subject of castles I propose to deal later
on. But there is one point on which the evidence of
this charter is perhaps more important than on any
other, and that is in the retrospective light which it
throws on the system of reform introduced by the first
Henry.</p>

<p>Incidentally, we have here witness to that system, of
which the Pipe-Roll of 1130 is the solitary but vivid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
exponent, and under which the very name of "plea"
became a terror to all men. Every man was liable, on
the slightest pretext, to be brought within the meshes
of the law, with the object, as it seemed, and at least
with the result, of swelling the royal hoard (cf. pp. 11, 12,
<i>n.</i> 1). Even to secure one's simplest rights money had
always to be paid. Thus, here, Geoffrey stipulates that
he and his men are to hold their possessions "sine placito,"
and "ita quod ... non ponantur in ullo modo in placito
de aliquo forisfacto," etc., etc. So again, in his later
charter, we find him insisting that he and they shall hold
all their possessions "sine placito et sine pecuniæ donatione,"
and that "Rectum eis teneatur de eorum calumpniis
sine pecuniæ donatione." The exactions he dreaded
meet us at every turn on the Pipe-Roll of 1130.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, the charter, broadly speaking,
illustrates, by the retrograde concessions it extorts, the
cardinal factor in the long struggle between the feudal
nobles and their lord the king, namely, their jealousy of
that royal jurisdiction by which the Crown strove, and
eventually with success, to break their semi-independent
power, and to bring the whole realm into uniform subjection
to the law.</p>

<p>After the clauses conferring on Geoffrey the <i>hereditary</i>
shrievalty of Essex, a matter which I shall discuss further
on, there immediately follows this passage, the most
significant, as I deem it, in the whole charter:—</p>

<p class="small">"Et ut sit Capitalis Justicia in Essexiâ hereditabiliter mea et heredum
meorum de placitis et forisfactis que pertinuerint ad coronam
meam, ita quod non mittam aliam justiciam super eum in comitatu
illo nisi ita sit quod aliquando mittam aliquem de paribus suis qui
audiat cum illo quod placita mea juste tractentur."</p>

<p>The first point to be dealt with here is the phrase
"<i>Capitalis</i> Justicia in Essexiâ." Here we have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
term "capitalis" applied to the <i>justicia</i> of a single
county. On this I would lay some stress, for it has been
generally supposed that this style was reserved for the
Great Justiciary, the <i>alter ego</i> of the king himself.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_340" id="Ref_340" href="#Foot_340">[340]</a></span></p>

<p>In his learned observations on the "obscurities" of
the style "<i>justitia</i> or <i>justitiarius</i>," Dr. Stubbs writes that
"the <i>capitalis justitia</i> seems to be the only one of the
body to whom a determinate position as the king's representative
is assigned in formal documents" (i. 389). It
was probably the object of Geoffrey, when he secured this
particular style, to obtain for himself all the powers vested
in "the king's representative," and so to provide against
his supersession by a justiciar claiming in that capacity.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the witness of the charter to the
differentiation of the sheriff (<i>vicecomes</i>) and the justice
(<i>justitia</i>), for that is the development which its terms
involve.</p>

<p>Dr. Stubbs points out that, under the Norman kings,
"the authority of the sheriff, when he was relieved from
the company of the ealdorman, ... would have no check
except the direct control of the king" (i. 272); and
Gneist similarly observed that "After the withdrawal of
the eorl, the Anglo-Saxon shir-gerefa became the regular
governor of the county, who was henceforth no longer dependent
upon the eorl, but upon the personal orders of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
the king, and upon the organs of the Norman central administration"
(i. 140). And for a period of transition
between the two systems, the Anglo-Saxon and the late
Norman, the sheriff not only presided, in his court, as its
sole lay head, but also in a dual capacity. Dr. Stubbs, it
is true, with his wonted caution, does but suggest it as
"probable that whilst the sheriff in his character of
sheriff was competent to direct the customary business
of the court, it was in that of <i>justitia</i> that he transacted
special business under the king's writ."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_341" id="Ref_341" href="#Foot_341">[341]</a></span> But Gneist
treats of him, under a separate heading, in his capacity
of "royal justiciary" (i. 142). It is from this dual position
that there developed, by specialization of function,
two distinct officers, the sheriff (<i>vicecomes</i>) and the
justice (<i>justicia</i>). This is the development which, as yet,
has been somewhat imperfectly apprehended.</p>

<p>The centralizing policy of Henry I., operating through
the <i>Curia Regis</i>, has, I need hardly observe, been admirably
explained by Dr. Stubbs. He has shown how two methods
were employed to attain the end in view: the one, to call
up certain pleas from the local courts to the <i>curia</i>; the
other, to send down the officers of the <i>curia</i> to sit in the
local courts.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_342" id="Ref_342" href="#Foot_342">[342]</a></span> In the latter case, the royal officer ("justicia")
appeared as the representative of the central
power of which the <i>Curia Regis</i> was the exponent. Thus,
there were, again, for the county court two lay presidents,
but they were now the sheriff, as local authority, and the
justice, who represented the central. Such an arrangement
was, of course, a step in advance for the Crown,
which had thus secured for itself, through its justice, a
footing in the local courts.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_343" id="Ref_343" href="#Foot_343">[343]</a></span> But with this arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
neither side was able to rest satisfied. Broadly speaking,
if I may be allowed the expression, the Crown sought to
centralize the sheriff, and to exclude the local element;
the feudatories would fain have localized the justice, and
so have excluded the central. Thus, before the close of
Henry's reign, he had actually employed on a large scale
the officers of his <i>curia</i> as sheriffs of counties, and "by
these means," as Dr. Stubbs observes, "the king and
justiciar kept in their hands the reins of the entire judicial
administration" (i. 392).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_344" id="Ref_344" href="#Foot_344">[344]</a></span> The same policy was faithfully
followed by his grandson, a generation later, on the occasion
of the inquest of sheriffs (1170), when, says Dr.
Stubbs, "the sheriffs removed from their offices were most
of them local magnates, whose chances of oppression and
whose inclination towards a feudal administration of
justice were too great. In their place Henry instituted
officers of the Exchequer, less closely connected with the
counties by property, and more amenable to royal influence,
as well as more skilled administrators—another
step towards the concentration of the provincial jurisdiction
under the <i>Curia Regis</i>."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_345" id="Ref_345" href="#Foot_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
This passage enables us to see how essentially contrary
to the policy of the Crown were the provisions of Geoffrey's
charter. It not only feudalized the local shrievalty by
placing it in the hands of a feudal magnate, and, further
still, making it hereditary, but it seized upon the centralizing
office of justice, and made it as purely local, nay, as
feudal as the other.</p>

<p>But let us return to the point from which we started,
namely, the witness of Geoffrey's charter to the differentiation
of the sheriff and the justice. It proves that the
sheriff could no longer discharge the functions of "a royal
justiciary," without a separate appointment to that distinct
office. When we thus learn how Geoffrey became both
sheriff and justice of Essex, we can approach in the light
of that appointment the writ addressed "Ricardo de Luci
Justic' et Vicecomiti de Essexa," on which Madox relies
for Richard's tenure of the post of chief justiciary.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_346" id="Ref_346" href="#Foot_346">[346]</a></span> It
may be that Richard's appointment corresponded with that
of Geoffrey. But whatever uncertainty there may be on
this point, there can be none on the parallel between
Geoffrey's charter and that which Henry I. granted to the
citizens of London. Indeed, in all municipal charters of
the fullest and best type, we find the functions of the
sheriff and the justice dealt with in the same successive
order. The striking thought to be drawn from this is that
the feudatories and the towns, though their interests were
opposed <i>inter se</i>, presented to the Crown the same attitude
and sought from it the same exemptions. In proof of
this I here adduce three typical charters, arranged in
chronological order. The first is an extract from that
important charter which London obtained from Henry I.,
the second is taken from Geoffrey's charter, and the third
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
from that of Richard I. to Colchester, which I quote
because it contains the same word "justicia," and also
because it is, probably, little, if at all, known.</p>

</table>

<p>Here we have the two offices similarly distinct throughout.
We have also the <i>ballivi</i>, representing to the town
what the <i>vicecomes</i> represents to the shire, a point which
it is necessary to bear in mind. The "bailiff," so far as
the town was concerned, stood in the sheriff's shoes. So
also did the "coroner" (or "coroners") in those of the
justice. Indeed, at Colchester, two "coroners" represented
the "justice" of the charter. I cannot find that Dr.
Stubbs calls attention to the fact of this twin privilege,
the fact that exemption from the sheriff and from the
justice went, in these charters, hand in hand.</p>

<p>Lastly, we should observe that though, in these charters,
the clause relating to the sheriff precedes that which
relates to the justice, yet, conversely, in the enumeration
of those to whom a charter is directed, "justices" are
invariably, I believe, given the precedence of "sheriffs."
This, which would seem to have passed unnoticed, may
have an important bearing. Ordericus, in a famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
passage (xi. 2) describing Henry's ministers, tells us how
the king</p>

<p class="small">"favorabiliter illi obsequentes de ignobili stirpe illustravit, de pulvere,
ut ita dicam, extulit, dataque multiplici facultate <i>super</i> consules et
illustres oppidanos exaltavit.... Illos ... rex, cum de infimo genere
essent, nobilitavit, regali auctoritate de imo erexit, in fastigio potestatum
constituit, ipsis etiam spectabilibus regni principibus formidabiles
effecit."</p>

<p class="nodent">Observe how vivid a light such a passage as this throws
upon the clause in Geoffrey's charter:—</p>

<p class="small">"Non mittam aliam Justiciam <i>super</i> eum in Comitatu illo, nisi
ita sit quod aliquando mittam aliquem de paribus suis qui audiat cum
illo quod placita mea juste tractentur."</p>

<p>The whole clause breathes the very spirit of feudalism.
It betrays the hatred of Geoffrey and his class for those
upstarts, as they deemed them, the royal justices, who,
clad in all the authority of the Crown, intruded themselves
into their local courts and checked them in the exercise
of their power. Henceforth, in the courts of the favoured
earl, the representative of the Crown was to make his
appearance not regularly, but only now and then ("aliquando");
moreover, when he came, he was to figure in
court not as the superior ("super eum"), but as the
colleague ("cum illo") of the earl; and, lastly, he was not
to belong to the upstart ministerial class: he was to be
one of his own class—of his "peers" ("de paribus suis").</p>

<p>As an illustrative parallel to this clause, I am tempted
to quote a remarkable charter, unnoticed, it would seem,
not only by our historians, but even by Mr. Eyton himself.
The Assize of Clarendon, a quarter of a century
(1166) after the date of our charter to Geoffrey, contained
clauses specially aimed against such exemption as he
sought. Referring to these clauses, Dr. Stubbs writes:—</p>

<p class="small">"No franchise is to exclude the justices.... In the article which
directs the admission of the justices into every franchise may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
detected one sign of the anti-feudal policy which the king had all his
life to maintain."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_347" id="Ref_347" href="#Foot_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">But the clauses in question, though their sweeping character
fully justifies this description,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_348" id="Ref_348" href="#Foot_348">[348]</a></span> contrast strangely
with the humble, almost apologetic, charter in which
Henry II., immediately afterwards, announces that he is
only sending his "justicia" into the patrimony of St.
Cuthbert "by permission" of the bishop, and as a quite
exceptional measure, not to be taken again. It throws,
perhaps, some new light on the character and methods
of the king, when we find him thus stooping, in form, to
gain his point in fact.</p>

The first charter of the Empress has now been
sufficiently discussed. It was, of course, his possession
of the Tower that enabled Geoffrey to extort such terms,
the command of that fortress being essential to the
Empress, to overawe the disaffected citizens.</p>

We obtain incidentally, in another quarter, unique evidence on this
very point. There is printed in the <i>Cartulary of Ramsey</i> (Rolls Series),
vol. ii. p. 254, a precept from Nigel, Bishop of Ely, to William, Prior of Ely,
and others, notifying the agreement he has made with Walter, Abbot of
Ramsey:—"Sciatis me et Walterum Abbatem de Rameseia consilio et
assensu dominæ nostræ Imperatricis et Episcopi Wynton' Apost' sedis legati
aliorumque coepiscoporum meorum scilicet Linc', Norwycensis, Cestrensis,
Hereford', Sancti Davidis, et Roberti Comitis Gloecestrie, et Hugonis Comitis
et Brienni et Milonis ad voluntatem meam concordatos esse. Quapropter
mando et præcipio sicut me diligitis," etc., etc. This precept, in the printed
cartulary, is dated "1133-1144." These are absurdly wide limits, and a
little research would, surely, have shown that it must belong to the period
in which the Empress was triumphant, and during which the legate was with
her. This fixes it to March-June, 1141. Independent of the great interest
attaching to this document as representing a "concordia" in the court of
the Empress during her brief triumph, it affords in my opinion proof of the
<i>personnel</i> of her court at the time. Five of the seven bishops mentioned
were, as observed in the text, in regular attendance at her court, and we may
therefore, on the strength of this document, add those of "Chester" and
Norwich, as visiting it, at least, on this occasion. So with the laity. Three
of the four magnates named (of whom Miles had not yet received the earldom
of Hereford) were her constant companions, so that we may safely rely on
this evidence for the presence at her court on this occasion of Hugh, Earl of
Norfolk.</p>

question of episcopal election. Strong though the terms of her letter appear
to have been, the Empress here waives the right, on which her father and
her son insisted, of having the election conducted in her presence and in
her own chapel, and anticipated the later practice introduced by the charter
of John.</p>

This was presumably a grant of the borough of Maldon (<i>i.e.</i> the royal
rights in that borough), though Peverel's fee in Maldon was an escheat at the
time. The proof of this is not only that it is here described as a "borough"
(<i>burgus</i>), but also that its annual value was to be deducted from the sheriff's
ferm, which could only be the case if it formed part of the <i>corpus comitatus</i>,
<i>i.e.</i> was Crown demesne. In Domesday, Peverel's fee in Maldon was valued
at £12, and the royal manor at £16 ("ad pondus"), though it had been £24.
It was probably the latter which Henry II. granted to his brother William
as representing ("pro") £22 ("numero") (see Pipe-Rolls).</p>

"Graelengus" is proved to be identical with "Graelandus de Thania,"
the Essex tenant-in-capite of 1166, by Stephen's second charter (Christmas,
1141), which gives his holding as 7½ fees, the very amount at which he
returns it in his <i>Carta</i> (see p. 142). But his contemporary, Graeland "fitz
Gilbert" de Tany, on the Pipe-Rolls of Henry II., was probably so styled for
distinction, being a son of Gilbert de Tany who figures on the Essex Pipe-Roll
of 1158.</p>

On Robert Arundell, see Yeatman's <i>History of the House of Arundel</i>,
p. 49 (where too early a date is suggested for this charter), and p. 105 (where
it is implied that he was a tenant of the Earl of Gloucester). He occurs
repeatedly in the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I., and again in the Westminster
charters (1136) of Stephen. (See Appendix C.)</p>

Robert Malet also was a west-country baron. He figures in connection
with Warminster in the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I., and is among the witnesses
to the Westminster charters (1136), being there styled "Dapifer" (see
Appendix C.). The <i>carta</i> of the Abbot of Glastonbury (1166) proves that
he was the predecessor of William Malet, <i>dapifer</i> to Henry II.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_311" id="Foot_311" href="#Ref_311">[311]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another west-country baron. He was one of the rebels of 1138, when
he held Castle Carey against the king (<i>Hen. Hunt.</i>, p. 261; <i>Ord. Vit.</i>, v. 310;
<i>Gesta</i>, p. 43). According to Mr. Yeatman, he was son of "William Gouel
de Percival, called Lovel," Lord of Ivry (<i>History of the House of Arundel</i>,
p. 136). He is however wrongly termed by him "Robert (<i>sic</i>) Lovel" on
p. 268. He witnessed an early charter of the Empress to Glastonbury (<i>Journ.
B. A. A.</i>, xxxi. 390).</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_312" id="Foot_312" href="#Ref_312">[312]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ralph Paynell had instigated the Earl of Gloucester's raid on
Nottingham the previous September (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>, 128), and was one
of the rebels in 1138, when he held Dudley against the king (<i>ibid.</i>, 110).
He was presumably identical with the "Rad[ulfus] Paen[ellus]" of 1130
(<i>Rot. Pip</i>, 31 Hen. I.). He witnessed the charter to Roger de Valoines
(see p. 286), and three other charters of the Empress (<i>Journ. B. A. A.</i>, xxxi.
391, 395, 398), including the creation of the earldom of Hereford (25
July, 1141).</p>

Walchelin Maminot had been among the witnesses to the above Westminster
charters of (Easter) 1136, but had held Dover against the king in
1138 (<i>Ord. Vit.</i>, v. 310). when Ordericus (v. 111, 112) speaks of him as a
son-in-law of Robert de Ferrers (Earl of Derby). He witnessed the charter
to Roger de Valoines (see p. 286), and five other charters of the Empress
(<i>Journ. B. A. A.</i>, xxxi. 388, 391, 394 <i>bis</i>, 398), including the creation of
the earldom of Hereford (25 July 1141), and he appears in the Pipe-Rolls
and other records under Henry II. from 1155 to 1170.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_314" id="Foot_314" href="#Ref_314">[314]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Robert, natural son of Henry I. by Edith (afterwards married to Robert
d'Oilli of Oxford), and uterine brother, as Mr. Eyton observes (<i>Addl. MSS.</i>,
31,943, fol. 115), "to Henry d'Oilli of Hook-Norton." He appears in connection
with Devonshire in the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I., and is probably
identical with Robert "brother" of Earl Reginald of Cornwall (<i>vide ante</i>,
p. 82). He is mentioned as present (as "Robert fitz Edith") at the siege
of Winchester, a few weeks later (<i>Sym. Dun.</i>, ii. 310), and he was among
the witnesses to the Empress's charters (Oxford, 1142) to the earls of Oxford
and of Essex, and to her charter (Devizes) to Geoffrey de Mandeville the
younger (<i>vide post</i>). He subsequently witnessed Henry II.'s charter (? 1156)
to Henry de Oxenford (<i>Cart. Ant.</i> D., No. 42). See also <i>Liber Niger</i>.
Working from misleading copies, Mr. Eyton wrongly identifies this Robert
"filius Regis," as a witness to three charters of the Empress, with a Robert
fitz Reg<i>inald</i> (de Dunstanville) (<i>History of Shropshire</i>, ii. 271).</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_315" id="Foot_315" href="#Ref_315">[315]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Robert fitz Martin occurs in the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I. in connection
with Dorset. Dugdale and Mr. Eyton (<i>Addl. MSS.</i>, 31,943, fol. 90) affiliate
him as son of a Martin of Tours, who had established himself in Wales.
He witnessed two other charters of the Empress (<i>Journ. B. A. A.</i>, xxxi. 391,
395), both of them at Oxford. A son of his (filius Roberti filii Martini) held
five knights' fees of Glastonbury Abbey in 1166.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_316" id="Foot_316" href="#Ref_316">[316]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Robert fitz Hildebrand witnessed the Empress's second charter to
Geoffrey with that to the Earl of Oxford (<i>vide post</i>). See for his adultery,
treason, and shocking death (? 1143), <i>Gesta Stephani</i>, pp. 95, 96, where he
is described as "virum plebeium quidem, sed militari virtute approbatum."
He is also spoken of as "vir infimi generis, sed summæ semper malitiæ
machinator" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 93). He is affiliated by the editors of Ordericus
(Société de l'Histoire de France) as "Robert fils de Herbrand de Sauqueville"
(iii. 45, iv. 420), where also we learn that he had refused to embark
upon the White Ship. He was perhaps a brother of Richard fitz Hildebrand,
who held five fees from the Abbot of Sherborne and five from the Bishop
of Salisbury in 1166.</p>

William de Moiun (Mohun) had attested <i>eo nomine</i> the charter to
Glastonbury (<i>Journ. B. A. A.</i>, xxxi. 389; <i>Adam de Domerham</i>) which probably
passed soon after the election of the Empress (April 8) at Winchester
(see p. 83). He now attests, among the earls, as "<i>Comite</i> Willelmo de
Moion." This fixes his Creation as April-June, 1141. Courthope gives no
date for the creation, and no authority but his foundation charter to Bruton,
in which he styles himself "Comes Somersetensis." Dr. Stubbs, following
him, gives (under "dates and authorities for the empress's earldoms") no
date and no further authority (<i>Const. Hist.</i>, i. 362). Mr. Maxwell Lyte, in
his learned and valuable monograph on <i>Dunster and its Lords</i> (1882), quotes
the <i>Gesta Stephani</i> for the fact "that at the siege of Winchester, in 1140,
the empress bestowed on William de Mohun the title of Earl of Dorset"
(p. 6). But Winchester was besieged in (August-September) 1141, not in
1140, and though the writer does speak of "Willelmus de Mohun, quem
comitem ibi statuit Dorsetiæ" (p. 81), this charter proves that he postdates
the creation, as he also does that of Hereford, which he assigns to the same
siege (cf. pp. 125, <i>n.</i>, 194). Mr. Doyle, with his usual painstaking care, places
the creation (on the same authority) "before September, 1141" (which
happens, it will be seen, to be quite correct), and assigns his use of the above
style ("comes Somersetensis") to 1142. See also, on this point, p. 277 <i>infra</i>.</p>

All this, however, is subject to the assumption that this charter passed
at Westminster. That assumption rests on Dugdale's transcript and his statement
to that effect in his <i>Baronage</i>. There is nothing in the charter
(except, of course, the above difficulty) inconsistent with this statement,
which is strongly supported by the Valoines charter; but, unfortunately,
the transcript I have quoted from gives <i>Oxford</i> as the place of testing. But,
then, the word (<i>vide supra</i>) appears to have been added in a later hand,
and may have been inserted from confusion with the Empress's <i>second</i> charter
to Geoffrey, which did pass at Oxford. Still, there is no actual reason why
this charter may not have passed at Oxford, though its subject makes Westminster,
perhaps, the more likely place of the two. Personally, I feel no
doubt whatever that Westminster was the place.</p>

It is in this case alone, in the Empress's charter, that we can compare
the value with that in Domesday. The charter grants it "pro xl solidis."
In Domesday we read "Tunc et post valuit xl solidos. Modo lv" (ii. 93).</p>

Dr. Stubbs writes: "From the reign of Henry I. we have distinct
traces of a judicial system, a supreme court of justice, called the Curia Regis,
presided over by the king or justiciary, and containing other judges also
called justiciars, the chief being occasionally distinguished by the title of
'summus,' 'magnus,' or 'capitalis'" (<i>Const. Hist.</i>, i. 377). But, in another
place, he points out, of the Great Justiciar, Roger of Salisbury, that "several
other ministers receive the same name [<i>justitiarius</i>] even during the time at
which he was actually in office; even the title of <i>capitalis justitiarius</i> is
given to officers of the <i>Curia Regis</i> who were acting in subordination to
him" (i. 350). Of this he gives instances in point (i. 389). On the whole
it is safest, perhaps, to hold, as Dr. Stubbs suggested, that the style "capitalis"
was not reserved to the Great Justiciar alone till the reign of Henry
II. (i. 350).</p>

I cannot quite understand Gneist's view that "A better spirit is infused
into this portion of the legal administration by the severance of the farm-interest
(<i>firma</i>) from the judicial functions, which was effected by the
appointment of royal <i>justitiarii</i> in the place of the <i>vicecomes</i>. The reservation
of the royal right of interference now develops into a periodical
delegation of matters to criminal judges" (i. 180). It is probable that this
eminent jurist has a right conception of the change, and that, if it is
obscured, it is only by his mode of expression. But, when arguing from the
laws of Cnut and of Henry, as to pleas "in firma," he might, if one may
venture to say so, have added the higher evidence of Domesday. There are
several passages in the Great Survey bearing upon this subject, of which the
most noteworthy is, I think, this, which is found in the passage on Shrewsbury:—"Siquis
pacem regis manu propria datam scienter infringebat utlagus
fiebat. Qui vero pacem regis a vicecomite datam infringebat, C solidos
emendabat, et tantundem dabat qui Forestel vel Heinfare faciebat. <i>Has
iii forisfacturas</i> habebat in dominio rex E. in omni Angliâ extra firmas"

This charter is limited, by the names of the witnesses, to 1163-1166.
It can only, therefore, refer to the Assize of Clarendon, which conclusion is
confirmed by its language. It must consequently have been granted immediately
after it, before the king left England in March. Observe that the
two last witnesses are the very justices who were entrusted with the execution
of the Assize, and that "Earl Geoffrey," by the irony of fate, was no
other than the son and successor of Geoffrey de Mandeville himself.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<small>THE LOST CHARTER OF THE QUEEN.</small></h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">It</span> was at the very hour when the Empress seemed to have
attained the height of her triumph that her hopes were
dashed to the ground.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_353" id="Ref_353" href="#Foot_353">[353]</a></span> The disaster, as is well known,
was due to her own behaviour. As Dr. Stubbs has well
observed, "She, too, was on the crest of the wave and
had her little day ... she had not learned wisdom or
conciliation, and threw away opportunities as recklessly
as her rival."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_354" id="Ref_354" href="#Foot_354">[354]</a></span> Indeed, even William of Malmesbury
hints that the fault was hers.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_355" id="Ref_355" href="#Foot_355">[355]</a></span></p>

<p>The Queen, having pleaded in vain for her husband,
resolved to appeal to arms. Advancing on Southwark
at the head of the forces which she had raised from Kent,
and probably from Boulogne, she ravaged the lands of
the citizens with fire and sword before their eyes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_356" id="Ref_356" href="#Foot_356">[356]</a></span> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
citizens, who had received the Empress but grudgingly,
and were already alarmed by her haughty conduct, were
now reduced to desperation. They decided on rising
against their new mistress, and joining the Queen in her
struggle for the restoration of the king.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_357" id="Ref_357" href="#Foot_357">[357]</a></span> There is a
stirring picture in the <i>Gesta</i> of the sudden sounding of
the <i>tocsin</i>, and of the citizens pouring forth from the
gates amidst the clanging of the bells. The Empress was
taken so completely by surprise that she seems to have
been at table at the time, and she and her followers,
mounting in haste, had scarcely galloped clear of the
suburbs when the mob streamed into her quarters and
rifled them of all that they contained. So great, we are
told, was the panic of the fugitives that they scattered
in all directions, regardless of the Empress and her fate.
Although the <i>Gesta</i> is a hostile source, the evidence of
its author is here confirmed by that of the Continuator
of Florence.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_358" id="Ref_358" href="#Foot_358">[358]</a></span> William of Malmesbury, however, writing
as a partisan, will not allow that the Empress and her
brother were thus ignominiously expelled, but asserts
that they withdrew in military array.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_359" id="Ref_359" href="#Foot_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>The Empress herself fled to Oxford, and, afraid to
remain even there, pushed on to Gloucester. The king,
it is true, was still her prisoner, but her followers were
almost all dispersed; and the legate, who had secured her
triumph, was alienated already from her cause. Expelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
from the capital, and resisted in arms by no small
portion of the kingdom, her <i>prestige</i> had received a fatal
blow, and the moment for her coronation had passed
away, never to return.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_360" id="Ref_360" href="#Foot_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we may pause to glance for a moment at a
charter of singular interest for its mention of the citizens
of London and their faithful devotion to the king.</p>

<p class="small">"Hugo dei gratia Rothomagensis archiepiscopus senatoribus inclitis
civibus honoratis et omnibus commune London concordie gratiam,
salutem eternam. Deo et vobis agimus gratias pro vestra fidelitate
stabili et certa domino nostro regi Stephano jugiter impensa. Inde
per regiones notæ vestra nobilitas virtus et potestas."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_361" id="Ref_361" href="#Foot_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>It is tempting to see in this charter—unknown, it
would seem, to the historians of London—a mention of
the famous "communa," the "tumor plebis, timor regni,"
of 1191. But the term, here, is more probably employed,
as in the "communa liberorum hominum" of the Assize
of Arms (1181), and the "communa totius terre" of the
Great Charter (1215). At the same time, there are two
expressions which occur at this very epoch, and which
might support the former view. One is <i>conjuratio</i>, which,
as we have seen, the Continuator applies to the action
of the Londoners in 1141,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_362" id="Ref_362" href="#Foot_362">[362]</a></span> and which Richard of Devizes
similarly applies to the commune of 1191.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_363" id="Ref_363" href="#Foot_363">[363]</a></span> The other
is <i>communio</i>, which William of Malmesbury applies to
their government in the previous April, and which the
keen eye of Dr. Stubbs noted as "a description of
municipal unity which suggests that the communal idea
was already in existence as a basis of civil organization."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_364" id="Ref_364" href="#Foot_364">[364]</a></span>
But he failed, it would seem, to observe the passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
which follows, and which speaks of "omnes barones, qui
in eorum communionem jamdudum recepti fuerant." For
in this allusion we recognize a distinctive practice of
the "sworn commune," from that of Le Mans (1073),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_365" id="Ref_365" href="#Foot_365">[365]</a></span>
to that of London (1191), "in quam universi regni
magnates et ipsi etiam ipsius provinciæ episcopi jurare
coguntur."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_366" id="Ref_366" href="#Foot_366">[366]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, what of Geoffrey de Mandeville? A tale
is told of him by Dugdale, and accepted without question
by Mr. Clark,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_367" id="Ref_367" href="#Foot_367">[367]</a></span> which, so far as I can find, must be traced
to the following passage in Trivet:—</p>

<p class="small">"Igitur in die Nativitatis Precursoris Domini [June 24], <i>obsessâ
turri</i>, fugatur imperatrix de Londoniâ. Turrim autem Galfridus de
Magnavillâ potenter defendit, et egressu facto, Robertum civitatis
episcopum, partis adversæ fautorem, cepit apud manerium de
Fulham."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_368" id="Ref_368" href="#Foot_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>It is quite certain that this tale is untrustworthy as
it stands. We have seen above that Trivet's date for the
arrival of the Empress at London is similarly, beyond
doubt, erroneous.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_369" id="Ref_369" href="#Foot_369">[369]</a></span> That the citizens, when they suddenly
rose against the Empress, may also have blockaded Geoffrey
in his tower, not only as her ally, but as their own natural
enemy, is possible, nay, even probable. But that he
ventured forth, through their ranks, to Fulham, when
thus blockaded, is improbable, and that he captured the
bishop as an enemy of the Empress is impossible, for the
Empress herself had just installed him,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_370" id="Ref_370" href="#Foot_370">[370]</a></span> and we find him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
at her court a month later.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_371" id="Ref_371" href="#Foot_371">[371]</a></span> At the same time Trivet, we
must assume, cannot have invented all this. His story
must preserve a confused version of the facts as told in
some chronicle now lost, or, at least, unknown.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_372" id="Ref_372" href="#Foot_372">[372]</a></span> On this
assumption it may, perhaps, be suggested that Geoffrey
was indeed blockaded in the Tower, but that when he
accepted the Queen's offers, and thus made, as we shall
see, common cause with the citizens, he signalized his
defection from the cause of the Empress by seizing her
adherent the bishop,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_373" id="Ref_373" href="#Foot_373">[373]</a></span> and holding him a prisoner till,
as Holinshed implies, he purchased his freedom, and so
became free to join the Empress at Oxford.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_374" id="Ref_374" href="#Foot_374">[374]</a></span></p>

<p>And now let us come to the subject of this chapter,
the lost charter of the Queen.</p>

<p>That this charter was granted is an historical fact
hitherto absolutely unknown. No chronicler mentions the
fact, nor is there a trace of any such document, or even
of a transcript of its contents. And yet the existence of
this charter, like that of the planet Neptune, can be
established, in the words of Sir John Herschel, "with a
certainty hardly inferior to ocular demonstration." The
discovery, indeed, of that planet was effected (<i>magnis componere
parva</i>) by strangely similar means. For as the
perturbations of Uranus pointed to the existence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
Neptune, so the "perturbations" of Geoffrey de Mandeville
point to the existence of this charter.</p>

<p>We know that the departure of the Empress was
followed by the arrival of the Queen, with the result that
Geoffrey was again in a position to demand his own terms.
Had he continued to hold the Tower in the name of the
Empress, he would have made it a thorn in the side of the
citizens now that they had declared for her rival. We
hear, moreover, at this crisis, of offers by the Queen to
all those whom bribes or concessions could allure to her
side.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_375" id="Ref_375" href="#Foot_375">[375]</a></span> We have, therefore, the strongest presumption
that Geoffrey would be among the first to whom offers
were made. But it is not on presumption that we depend.
Stephen, we shall find, six months later, refers distinctly
to this lost charter ("Carta Reginæ"),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_376" id="Ref_376" href="#Foot_376">[376]</a></span> and the Empress
in turn, in the following year, refers to the charters of the
king <i>and of the queen</i> ("quas Rex Stephanus <i>et Matildis
regina</i> ei dederunt ... sicut habet inde cartas ill<i>orum</i>").<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_377" id="Ref_377" href="#Foot_377">[377]</a></span>
Thus its existence is beyond question. And that it passed
about this time may be inferred, not only from the circumstances
of the case, but also from the most significant
fact that, a few weeks later, at the siege of Winchester,
we find Geoffrey supporting the Queen in active concert
with the citizens.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_378" id="Ref_378" href="#Foot_378">[378]</a></span></p>

<p>What were the terms of the charter by which he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
thus regained to his allegiance we cannot now tell. To
judge, however, from that of Stephen, which was mainly
a confirmation of its terms, it probably represented a
distinct advance on the concessions he had wrung from
the Empress.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact, and one which probably is
known to few, if any, that there is still preserved in the
Public Record Office a solitary charter of the Queen,
granted, I cannot but think, at this very crisis. As it is
not long, I shall here quote it as a unique and instructive
record.</p>

<p class="small">"M. Regina Angl[ie] Omnibus fidelibus suis francis et Anglis
salutem. Sciatis quod dedi Gervasio Justiciario de Lond[oniâ] x
marcatas terræ in villâ de Gamelingeia pro servicio suo ... donec ei
persolvam debitum quod ei debeo, ut infra illum terminum habeat
proficua que exibunt de villa predictâ ... testibus Com[ite] Sim[one]

name="Ref_379" id="Ref_379" href="#Foot_379">[379]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of the witnesses, Earl Simon (of Northampton),
is known to have been one of the three earls
who adhered to the Queen during the king's captivity.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_380" id="Ref_380" href="#Foot_380">[380]</a></span>
Richard of Boulogne was possibly a brother of her <i>nepos</i>,
"Pharamus" of Boulogne, who is also known to have
been with her.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_381" id="Ref_381" href="#Foot_381">[381]</a></span> Combining the fact of the charter being
the Queen's with that of its subject-matter and that of
its place of testing, we obtain the strongest possible presumption
that it passed at this crisis, a presumption confirmed,
as we have seen, by the name of the leading
witness. The endeavour to fix the date of this charter
is well worth the making. For it is not merely of interest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
as a record unique of its kind. If it is, indeed, of the
date suggested, it is, to all appearance, the sole survivor
of all those charters, such as that to Geoffrey, by which
the Queen, in her hour of need, must have purchased
support for the royal cause. We see her, like the queen of
Henry III., like the queen of Charles I., straining every
nerve to succour her husband, and to raise men and
means. And as Henrietta Maria pledged her jewels as
security for the loans she raised, so Matilda is here shown
as pledging a portion of her ancestral "honour" to raise
the sinews of war.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_382" id="Ref_382" href="#Foot_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>But this charter, if the date I have assigned to it be
right, does more for us than this. It gives us, for an
instant, a precious glimpse of that of which we know so
little, and would fain know so much—I mean the government
of London. We learn from it that London had then
a "justiciary," and further that his name was Gervase.
Nor is even this all. The Gamlingay entry in the <i>Testa
de Nevill</i> and <i>Liber Niger</i> enables us to advance a step
further and to establish the identity of this Gervase with
no other than Gervase of Cornhill.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_383" id="Ref_383" href="#Foot_383">[383]</a></span> The importance of
this identification will be shown in a special appendix.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_384" id="Ref_384" href="#Foot_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>Among those whom the Queen strove hard to gain was
her husband's brother, the legate.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_385" id="Ref_385" href="#Foot_385">[385]</a></span> He had headed, as we
have seen, the witnesses to Geoffrey's charter, but he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
deeply injured at the failure of his appeal, on behalf of his
family, to the Empress, and was even thought to have
secretly encouraged the rising of the citizens of London.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_386" id="Ref_386" href="#Foot_386">[386]</a></span>
He now kept aloof from the court of the Empress, and,
having held an interview with the Queen at Guildford,
resolved to devote himself, heart and soul, to setting his
brother free.<span class="fnanchor"><a

p. 78). These expressions appear to imply that she not only wasted the
southern bank, but sent over (<i>transmisit</i>) her troops to plunder round the
walls of the city itself (<i>circa civitatem</i>). Mr. Pearson strangely assigns
this action not to the Queen, but to the Empress: "Matilda brought up
troops, and cut off the trade of the citizens, and wasted their lands, to
punish their disaffection" (p. 478).</p>

The <i>Annals of Plympton</i> (ed. Liebermann, p. 20) imply that the city
was divided on the subject:—"In mense Junio facta est sedicio in civitate
Londoniensi a civibus; sed tamen pars sanior vices imperatricis agebat,
pars vero quedam eam obpugnabat."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<small>THE ROUT OF WINCHESTER.</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
Empress, it will be remembered, in the panic of her
escape, on the sudden revolt of the citizens, had fled to
the strongholds of her cause in the west, and sought
refuge in Gloucester. Most of her followers were scattered
abroad, but the faithful Miles of Gloucester was found, as
ever, by her side. As soon as she recovered from her first
alarm, she retraced her steps to Oxford, acting upon his
advice, and made that fortress her head-quarters, to which
her adherents might rally.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_388" id="Ref_388" href="#Foot_388">[388]</a></span></p>

<p>To her stay at Oxford on this occasion we may assign
a charter to Haughmond Abbey, tested <i>inter alios</i> by the
King of Scots.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_389" id="Ref_389" href="#Foot_389">[389]</a></span> But of far more importance is the well-known
charter by which she granted the earldom of
Hereford to her devoted follower, Miles of Gloucester.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_390" id="Ref_390" href="#Foot_390">[390]</a></span>
With singular unanimity, the rival chroniclers testify to
the faithful service of which this grant was the reward.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_391" id="Ref_391" href="#Foot_391">[391]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
It is an important fact that this charter contains a record
of its date, which makes it a fixed point of great value for
our story. This circumstance is the more welcome from the
long list of witnesses, which enables us to give with absolute
certainty the <i>personnel</i> of Matilda's court on the day this
charter passed (July 25, 1141), evidence confirmed by
another charter omitted from the fasciculus of Mr. Birch.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_392" id="Ref_392" href="#Foot_392">[392]</a></span>
From a comparison of the dates we can assign these
documents to the very close of her stay at Oxford, by
which time her scattered followers had again rallied to her
standard. It is also noteworthy that the date is in
harmony with the narrative of the Continuator of Florence.
This has a bearing on the chronology of that writer, to
which we have now in the main to trust.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury, who on the doings of his
patron is likely to be well informed, tells us that the
rumours of the legate's defection led the Earl of Gloucester
to visit Winchester in the hope of regaining him to his
sister's cause. Disappointed in this, he rejoined her at
Oxford.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_393" id="Ref_393" href="#Foot_393">[393]</a></span> It must have been on his return that he witnessed
the charter to Miles of Gloucester.</p>

<p>The Empress, on hearing her brother's report, decided
to march on Winchester with the forces she had now
assembled.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_394" id="Ref_394" href="#Foot_394">[394]</a></span> The names of her leading followers can be
recovered from the various accounts of the siege.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_395" id="Ref_395" href="#Foot_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
The Continuator states that she reached Winchester
shortly before the 1st of August.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_396" id="Ref_396" href="#Foot_396">[396]</a></span> He also speaks of the
siege having lasted seven weeks on the 13th of September.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_397" id="Ref_397" href="#Foot_397">[397]</a></span>
If he means by this, as he implies, the siege
by the queen's forces, he is clearly wrong; but if he was
thinking of the arrival of the Empress, this would place
that event not later than the 27th of July. We know
from the date of the Oxford charter that it cannot well
have been earlier. The <i>Hyde Cartulary</i> (Stowe MSS.) is
more exact, and, indeed, gives us the day of her arrival,
Thursday, July 31 ("pridie kal. Augusti"). According to
the <i>Annals of Waverley</i>, the Empress besieged the bishop
the next day.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_398" id="Ref_398" href="#Foot_398">[398]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the struggle which now took place we have several
independent accounts. Of these the fullest are those given
by the Continuator, who here writes with a bitter feeling
against the legate, and by the author of the <i>Gesta</i>, whose
sympathies were, of course, on the other side. John of
Hexham, William of Malmesbury, and Henry of Huntingdon
have accounts which should be carefully consulted,
and some information is also to be gleaned from the <i>Hyde
Cartulary</i> (Stowe MSS.).</p>

<p>It is John of Hexham alone who mentions that the
bishop himself had commenced operations by besieging
the royal castle, which was held by a garrison of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
Empress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_399" id="Ref_399" href="#Foot_399">[399]</a></span> It was in this castle, says the Continuator,
that she took up her quarters on her arrival.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_400" id="Ref_400" href="#Foot_400">[400]</a></span> She at
once summoned the legate to her presence, but he, dreading
that she would seize his person, returned a temporizing
answer, and eventually rode forth from the city (it would
seem, by the east gate) just as the Empress entered it in
state.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_401" id="Ref_401" href="#Foot_401">[401]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the Continuator asserts that the Empress, on
her arrival, found the city opposed to her, William of
Malmesbury, whose sympathies were the same, asserts,
on the contrary, that the citizens were for her.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_402" id="Ref_402" href="#Foot_402">[402]</a></span> Possibly,
the former may only have meant that she had found the
gates of the city closed against her by the legate. In
any case, she now established herself, together with her
followers, within the walls, and laid siege to the episcopal
palace, which was defended by the legate's garrison.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_403" id="Ref_403" href="#Foot_403">[403]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
The usual consequence followed. From the summit of
the keep its reckless defenders rained down fire upon the
town, and a monastery, a nunnery, more than forty (?)
churches, and the greater part of the houses within the
walls are said to have been reduced to ashes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_404" id="Ref_404" href="#Foot_404">[404]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the legate had summoned to his aid the
Queen and all the royal party. His summons "was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
promptly obeyed;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_405" id="Ref_405" href="#Foot_405">[405]</a></span> even the Earl of Chester, "who,"
says Dr. Stubbs, "was uniformly opposed to Stephen,
but who no doubt fought for himself far more than for
the Empress,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_406" id="Ref_406" href="#Foot_406">[406]</a></span> joined, on this occasion, the royal forces,
perhaps to maintain the balance of power. But his
assistance, naturally enough, was viewed with such deep
suspicion that he soon went over to the Empress,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_407" id="Ref_407" href="#Foot_407">[407]</a></span> to
whom, however, his tardy help was of little or no value.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_408" id="Ref_408" href="#Foot_408">[408]</a></span>
From London the Queen received a well-armed contingent,
nearly a thousand strong;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_409" id="Ref_409" href="#Foot_409">[409]</a></span> but Henry of Huntingdon
appears to imply that their arrival, although it turned
the scale, did not take place till late in the siege.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_410" id="Ref_410" href="#Foot_410">[410]</a></span></p>

<p>The position of the opposing forces became a very
strange one. The Empress and her followers, from the
castle, besieged the bishop's palace, and were in turn themselves
besieged by the Queen and her host without.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_411" id="Ref_411" href="#Foot_411">[411]</a></span> It
was the aim of the latter to cut off the Empress from her
base of operations in the west. With this object they
burnt Andover,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_412" id="Ref_412" href="#Foot_412">[412]</a></span> and harassed so successfully the enemy's
convoys, that famine was imminent in the city.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_413" id="Ref_413" href="#Foot_413">[413]</a></span> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
Empress, moreover, was clearly outnumbered by the forces
of the Queen and legate. It is agreed on all hands that the
actual crisis was connected with an affair at Wherwell, but
John of Hexham and the author of the <i>Gesta</i> are not
entirely in accord as to the details. According to the
latter, who can hardly be mistaken in a statement so precise,
the besieged, now in dire straits, despatched a small
force along the old Icknield Way, to fortify Wherwell and
its nunnery, commanding the passage of the Test, in order
to secure their line of communication.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_414" id="Ref_414" href="#Foot_414">[414]</a></span> John of Hexham,
on the contrary, describing, it would seem, the same incident,
represents it as merely the despatch of an escort,
under John the Marshal and Robert fitz Edith, to meet
an expected convoy.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_415" id="Ref_415" href="#Foot_415">[415]</a></span> In any case, it is clear that William
of Ypres, probably the Queen's best soldier, burst upon
the convoy close to Wherwell, and slew or captured all but
those who sought refuge within the nunnery walls.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_416" id="Ref_416" href="#Foot_416">[416]</a></span> Nor
are the two accounts gravely inconsistent.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Continuator of Florence appears
at first sight to imply that the Marshal and his followers
took refuge at Wherwell in the course of the general
flight,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_417" id="Ref_417" href="#Foot_417">[417]</a></span> and this version is in harmony with the <i>Histoire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
de Guillaume le Maréchal</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_418" id="Ref_418" href="#Foot_418">[418]</a></span> But putting aside William
of Malmesbury, whose testimony is ambiguous on the
point, I consider the balance to be clearly in favour of
the <i>Gesta</i> and John of Hexham, whose detailed accounts
must be wholly rejected if we embrace the other version,
whereas the Continuator's words can be harmonized, and
indeed better understood, if we take "ad monasterium
Warewellense fugientem" as referring to John taking
refuge in the nunnery (as described in the other versions)
when surprised with his convoy. Moreover, the evidence
(<i>vide infra</i>) as to the Empress leaving Winchester by the
west instead of the north gate, appears to me to clinch
the matter. As to the Marshal poem, on such a point its
evidence is of little weight. Composed at a later period,
and based on family tradition, its incidents, as M. Meyer
has shown, are thrown together in wrong order, and its
obvious errors not a few. I may add that the Marshal's
position is unduly exalted in the poem, and that Brian fitz
Count (though it is true that he accompanied the Empress in
her flight) would never have taken his orders from John the
Marshal.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_419" id="Ref_419" href="#Foot_419">[419]</a></span> Its narrative cannot be explained away, but it is
the one that we are most justified in selecting for rejection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
To expel the fugitives from their place of safety,
William and his troopers fired the nunnery. A furious
struggle followed in the church, amidst the shrieks of the
nuns and the roar of the flames; the sanctuary itself
streamed with blood; but John the Marshal stood his
ground, and refused to surrender to his foes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_420" id="Ref_420" href="#Foot_420">[420]</a></span> "Silence,
or I will slay thee with mine own hands," the undaunted
man is said to have exclaimed, as his last remaining
comrade implored him to save their lives.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_421" id="Ref_421" href="#Foot_421">[421]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
On receiving intelligence of this disaster, the besieged
were seized with panic, and resolved on immediate retreat.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_422" id="Ref_422" href="#Foot_422">[422]</a></span>
William of Malmesbury, as before, is anxious to deny the
panic,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_423" id="Ref_423" href="#Foot_423">[423]</a></span> and the Continuator accuses the legate
of treachery.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_424" id="Ref_424" href="#Foot_424">[424]</a></span>
The account, however, in the <i>Gesta</i> appears thoroughly
trustworthy. According to this, the Empress and her
forces sallied forth from the gates in good order, but
were quickly surrounded and put to flight. All order was
soon at an end. Bishops, nobles, barons, troopers, fled in
headlong rout. With her faithful squire by her side the
Empress rode for her life.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_425" id="Ref_425" href="#Foot_425">[425]</a></span> The Earl of Gloucester, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
the rear-guard, covered his sister's retreat, but in so doing
was himself made prisoner, while holding, at Stockbridge,
the passage of the Test.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_426" id="Ref_426" href="#Foot_426">[426]</a></span></p>

<p>The mention of Stockbridge proves that the besieged
must have fled by the Salisbury road, their line of retreat
by Andover being now barred at Wherwell. After crossing
the Test, the fugitive Empress must have turned northwards,
and made her way, by country lanes, over Longstock
hills, to Ludgershall. So great was the dread of
her victorious foes, now in full pursuit, that though she had
ridden more than twenty miles, and was overwhelmed with
anxiety and fatigue, she was unable to rest even here, and,
remounting, rode for Devizes, across the Wiltshire downs.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_427" id="Ref_427" href="#Foot_427">[427]</a></span>
It was not, we should notice, thought safe for her to make
straight for Gloucester, through Marlborough and Cirencester;
so she again set her face due west, as if making
for Bristol. Thus fleeing from fortress to fortress, she came
to her castle at Devizes. So great, however, was now her
terror that even in this celebrated stronghold<span class="fnanchor"><a

not, she feared, be safe. She had already ridden some
forty miles, mainly over bad country, and what with grief,
terror, and fatigue, the erst haughty Empress was now
"more dead than alive" (<i>pene exanimis</i>). It was out of
the question that she should mount again; a litter was
hurriedly slung between two horses, and, strapped to this,
the unfortunate Lady was conveyed in sorry guise (<i>sat
ignominiose</i>) to her faithful city of Gloucester.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>On a misunderstanding, as I deem it, of the passage
(and especially of the word <i>feretrum</i>), writers have successively,
for three centuries, represented the Continuator
as stating that the Empress, "to elude the vigilance of
her pursuers," was "laid out as a corpse!" Lingard,
indeed, while following suit, gravely doubts if the fact
be true, as it is recorded by the Continuator alone; but
Professor Pearson improves upon the story, and holds
that the versatile "Lady" was in turn "a trooper" and
a corpse.<span class="fnanchor"><a

There is some confusion as to what the Empress actually besieged. The
<i>Gesta</i> says it was "(1) castellum episcopi, quod venustissimo constructum
schemate in civitatis medio locarat, sed et (2) domum illius, quam ad instar
castelli fortiter et inexpugnabiliter firmarat." We learn from the <i>Annals of
Winchester</i> (p. 51) that, in 1138, the bishop "fecit ædificare domum quasi
palatium cum turri fortissima in Wintonia," which would seem to be
Wolvesey, with its keep, at the south-east angle of the city. Again,
Giraldus has a story (vii. 46) that the bishop built himself a residence from
the materials of the Conqueror's palace: "Domos regios apud Wintoniam
ecclesie ipsius atrio nimis enormiter imminentes, ... funditus in brevi
raptim et subito ... dejecit, et ... ex dirutis ædificiis et abstractis domos
episcopales egregias sibi in eadem urbe construxit." On the other hand, the
<i>Hyde Cartulary</i> assigns the destruction of the palace to the siege (<i>vide
infra</i>.).</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_404" id="Foot_404" href="#Ref_404">[404]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Interea ex turre pontificis jaculatum incendium in domos burgensium
(qui, ut dixi, proniores erant imperatricis felicitati) comprehendit et
combussit abbatiam totam sanctimonialium intra urbem, simulque cænobium
quod dicitur ad Hidam extra" (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, p. 752). "Qui intus recludebantur
ignibus foras emissis majorem civitatis partem sed et duas abbatias
in favillas penitus redegerunt" (<i>Gesta</i>, p. 83). "Siquidem secundo die
mensis Augusti ignis civitati immissis, monasterium sanctimonialium cum
suis ædificiis, ecclesias plus <small>XL</small> cum majori seu meliori parte civitatis,
postremo cænobium monachorum Deo et Sancto Grimbaldo famulantium,
cum suis ædibus redegit in cineres" (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>, p. 133). It is from
this last writer that we get the date (August 2), which we should never
have gathered from William of Malmesbury (who mentions this fire in conjunction
with the burning of Wherwell Abbey, at the close of the siege) or
from the <i>Gesta</i>. M. Paris (<i>Chron. Maj.</i>, ii. 174) assigns the fire, like William
of Malmesbury, to the end of the siege, but his version, "Destructa est
Wintonia <small>XVIII</small> kal. Oct., et captus est R. Comes Glovernie die exaltationis
Sancte Crucis," is self-stultifying, the two dates being one and the same.
The Continuator's date is confirmed by the independent evidence of the <i>Hyde
Cartulary</i> (among the Stowe MSS.), which states that on Saturday, the 2nd
of August ("Sabbato <small>IIII.</small> non. Augusti"), the city was burned by the
bishop's forces, "et eodem die dicta civitas Wyntonie capta est et spoliata."
From this source we further obtain the interesting fact that the Conqueror's
palace in the city ("totum palatium cum aula sua") perished on this
occasion. Allusion is made to this fact in the same cartulary's account of a
council held by Henry of Winchester in the cathedral, in November, 1150,
where the parish of St. Laurence is assigned the site "super quam aulam
suam et palacium edificari fecit (Rex Willelmus)," which palace "in adventu
Roberti Comitis Gloecestrie combustum fuit." The Continuator (<i>more suo</i>)
assigns the fire to the cruelty of the bishop; but it was the ordinary practice
in such cases. As from the tower of Le Mans in 1099 (<i>Ord. Vit.</i>), as from
the tower of Hereford Cathedral but a few years before this (<i>Gesta Stephani</i>),
so now at Winchester the firebrands flew: and so again at Lewes, in far later
days (1264), where on the evening of the great battle there blazed forth from
the defeated Royalists, sheltered on the castle height, a mad shower of fire.</p>

veritas habet) ad ecclesiæ detrimentum, ædificatum" (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, pp. 717,
718). It had been raised by the Bishop of Salisbury, and it passed, at his
fall, into Stephen's hands. It is then described by the author of the <i>Gesta</i>
(p. 66) as "castellum regis, quod Divisa dicebatur, ornanter et inexpugnabiliter
muratum." It was subsequently surprised by Robert fitz Hubert,
who held it for his own hand till his capture, when the Earl of Gloucester
tried hard to extort its surrender from him. In this, however, he failed.
Robert was hanged, and, soon after, his garrison sold it to Stephen, by whom
it was entrusted to Hervey of Brittany, whom he seems to have made Earl
of Wilts. But on Stephen's capture, the peasantry rose, and extorted its
surrender from Hervey. Thenceforth, it was a stronghold of the Empress
(see for this the Continuator and the <i>Gesta</i>).</p>

"Cum nec ibi secure se tutari posse, ob insequentes, formidaret, jam pene
exanimis feretro invecta, et funibus quasi cadaver ligata, equis deferentibus,
sat ignominiose ad civitatem deportatur Glaornensem" (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>,
134). The author of the <i>Gesta</i> (p. 85) mentions her flight to Devizes ("Brieno
tantum cum paucis comite, ad Divisas confugit"), and incidentally
observes (p. 87) that she was "ex Wintoniensi dispersione quassa nimis, et
usque ad defectum pené defatigata" (<i>i.e.</i> "tired to death;" cf. <i>supra</i>). John
of Hexham merely says: "Et imperatrix quidem non sine magno conflictu
et plurima difficultate erepta est" (<i>Sym. Dun.</i>, ii. 310).</p>

Camden, in his <i>Britannia</i>, gives the story, but Knighton (De eventibus
Angliæ, lib. ii., in <i>Scriptores</i> X.) seems to be the chief offender. Dugdale follows
with the assertion that "she was necessitated ... for her more security to
be put into a coffin, as a dead corps, to escape their hands" (i. 537 <i>b</i>).
According to Milner (<i>History of Winchester</i>, p. 162), "she was enclosed like a
corpse in a sheet of lead, and was thus suffered to pass in a horse-litter as
if carried out for interment, through the army of her besiegers, a truce
having been granted for this purpose." Even Edwards, in his introduction
to the <i>Liber de Hyda</i> (p. xlviii.), speaks of "the raising of the siege; a raising
precipitated, if we accept the accounts of Knighton and some other chroniclers
who accord with him, by the strange escape of the Empress Maud from
Winchester Castle concealed in a leaden coffin." <i>Sic crescit eundo.</i></p>

See donation of Miles (<i>Monasticon</i>, vi. 137), stated to have been made in
their presence, and in the year 1141, in which he speaks of himself as "apud
Bristolium positus, jamque consulatus honorem adeptus." Brian had escorted
the Empress in her flight, but Miles, intercepted by the enemy, had barely
escaped with his life ("de solâ vita lætus ad Glaornam cum dedecore
fugiendo pervenit lassus, solus, et pene nudus."—<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>, p. 135).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<small>THE SECOND CHARTER OF THE KING.</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
liberation of the king from his captivity was hailed
with joy by his adherents, and not least, we may be sure,
in his loyal city of London. The greatness of the
event is seen, perhaps, in the fact that it is even mentioned
in a private London deed of the time, executed "Anno
MCXLI., Id est in exitu regis Stephani de captione Roberti
filii regis Henrici."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_432b" id="Ref_432b" href="#Foot_432b">[432]</a></span></p>

<p>In spite of his faults we may fairly assume that the
king's imprisonment had aroused a popular reaction in
his favour, as it did in the case of Charles I., five centuries
later. The experiences also of the summer had been
greatly in his favour. For, however unfit he may have
been to fill the throne himself, he was able now to point to
the fact that his rival had been tried and found wanting.</p>

<p>He would now be eager to efface the stain inflicted on
his regal dignity, to show in the sight of all men that he
was again their king, and then to execute vengeance on
those whose captive he had been. The first step to be
taken was to assemble a council of the realm that should
undo the work of the April council at Winchester, and
formally recognize in him the rightful possessor of the
throne. This council met on the 7th of December at
Westminster, the king himself being present.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_433" id="Ref_433" href="#Foot_433">[433]</a></span> The
ingenious legate was now as ready to prove that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
brother, and not the Empress, should rightly fill the
throne, as, we saw, he was in April to prove the exact
reverse. The two grounds on which he based his renunciation
were, first, that the Empress had failed to fulfil
her pledges to the Church;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_434" id="Ref_434" href="#Foot_434">[434]</a></span> second, that her failure
implied the condemnation of God.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_435" id="Ref_435" href="#Foot_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>A solemn coronation might naturally follow, to set, as
it were, the seal to the work of this assembly. Perhaps
the nearest parallel to this second coronation is to be
found in that of Richard I., in 1194, after his captivity
and humiliation.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_436" id="Ref_436" href="#Foot_436">[436]</a></span> I think we have evidence that
Stephen himself looked on this as a second coronation,
and as no mere "crown-wearing," in a precept in favour
of the monks of Abingdon, in which he alludes incidentally
to the day of his <i>first</i> coronation.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_437" id="Ref_437" href="#Foot_437">[437]</a></span> This clearly implies
a second coronation since; and as the precept is attested
by Richard de Luci, it is presumably subsequent to that
second coronation, to which we now come.</p>

<p>It cannot be wondered that this event has been unnoticed
by historians, for it is only recorded in a single
copy of the works of a single chronicler. We are indebted
to Dr. Stubbs and his scholarly edition of the writings
of Gervase of Canterbury for our knowledge of the fact that
in one, and that comparatively imperfect, of the three
manuscripts on which his text is based, we read of a
coronation of Stephen, at Canterbury, "placed under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
1142." We learn from him that in this MS. "it is probably
inserted in a wrong place," as indeed is evident from
the fact that at Christmas, 1142, Stephen was at Oxford.
Here is the passage in question:—</p>

<p class="small">"Deinde rex Stephanus una cum regina et nobilitate procerum ad
Natale Domini gratiosus adveniens, in ipsa solempnitate in ecclesiâ
Christi a venerabili Theobaldo ejusdem ecclesiæ archiepiscopo coronatus
est; ipsa etiam regina cum eo ibidem coronam auream gestabat
in capite" (<i>Gervase</i>, i. 123).</p>

<p>It should perhaps be noticed that, while the Queen is merely
said to have worn her crown, Stephen is distinctly stated
to have been crowned. I cannot but think that this must
imply a distinction between them, and supports the view
that this coronation was due to the captivity of the king.</p>

<p>My contention is that the date of this event was
Christmas, 1141, and that the choice, for its scene, of the
Kentish capital was a graceful compliment to that county
which, in the darkest hour of the king's fortunes, had
remained faithful to his cause, and to the support of which
his restoration had been so largely due.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_438" id="Ref_438" href="#Foot_438">[438]</a></span></p>

<p>I further hold that the second charter granted to
Geoffrey de Mandeville was executed on this occasion,
and that in its witnesses we have the list of that "nobilitas
procerum" by which, according to Gervase, this coronation
was attended.</p>

<p>This charter, when rightly dated, is indeed the keystone
of my story. For without it we could not form that series
on which the sequence of events is based. It is admittedly
subsequent to the king's liberation, for it refers to the
battle of Lincoln. It must also be previous to Geoffrey's
death in 1144. These are the obvious limits given in the
official calendar.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_439" id="Ref_439" href="#Foot_439">[439]</a></span> But it must further be previous to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
Geoffrey's fall in 1143. Lastly, it must be previous to the
Oxford, or second, charter of the Empress, in which we
shall find it is referred to. As that charter cannot be
later than the summer of 1142, our limit is again narrowed.
Now the charter is tested at Canterbury. Stephen cannot,
it seems, have been there in the course of 1142. This
accordingly leaves us, as the only possible date, the close
of 1141; and this is the very date of the king's coronation
at Canterbury. When we add to this train of reasoning
the fact that the number of earls by whom the charter is
witnessed clearly points to some great state ceremonial,
we cannot feel the slightest doubt that the charter must,
as I observed, have passed on this occasion. With this
conclusion its character will be found in complete accordance,
for it plainly represents the price for which the
traitor earl consented to change sides again, and to place
at the disposal of his outraged king that Tower of London,
its citadel and its dread, the possession of which once
more enabled him to dictate his own terms.</p>

<p>Those terms were that, in the first place, he should
forfeit nothing for his treason in having joined the cause
of the Empress, and should be confirmed in his possession
of all that he held before the king's capture. But his
demands far exceeded the mere <i>status quo ante</i>. Just as he
had sold his support to the Empress when she gave him
an advance on Stephen's terms, so the Queen must have
brought him back by offering terms, at the crisis of the
struggle, in excess even of those which he had just wrung
from the Empress. He would now insist that these great
concessions should be confirmed by the king himself.
Such is the explanation of the strange character of this
Canterbury charter.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">It will at once be seen that this charter is one of
extraordinary interest.</p>

<p>The first point to strike one, on examining the list of
witnesses, is the presence of no less than eight earls and
of no more than one bishop. To these, indeed, we may
add perhaps, though by no means of necessity, the Earl of
Essex himself. Though the evidence is, of course, merely
negative, it is probable, to judge from similar cases, that
had other bishops been present, they would appear among
the witnesses to the charter. The absence of their names,
therefore, is somewhat difficult to explain, unless (if
present) they were at enmity with Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Another point deserving of notice is that this great
gathering of earls enables us to draw some important conclusions
as to the origin and development of their titles.
We may, for instance, safely infer that when a Christian
name was borne by one earl alone, he used for his style
that name with the addition of "Comes" either as a
prefix or as a suffix. Thus we have in this instance
"Comes Alanus" and "Comes Simon." But when two
or more earls bore the same Christian name, they had to
be distinguished by some addition. Thus we have "Comes
Gislebertus de Pembroc" and "Comes Gislebertus de
Heortford," or "Comes Robertus de Ferrers," as distinguished
from Earl Robert "of Gloucester." The addition
of "de Essexa" to Earl Geoffrey himself, which is found
in this and other charters (see pp. 158, 183), can only,
it would seem, be intended to distinguish him from Count
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
Geoffrey of Anjou. But here the striking case is that
of "Willelmo Comite Warenna," "Willelmo Comite de
Albarmarlâ," and "Comite Willelmo de Sudsexâ." These
examples show us how perfectly immaterial was the source
from which the description was taken. "Warenna" is
used as if a surname; "Albarmarla" is "Aumâle," a
local name; and "Sudsexa" needs no comment. The
same noble who here attests as Earl of "Albarmarla"
elsewhere attests as Earl "of York," while the Earl "of
Sussex" is elsewhere a witness as Earl "of Chichester"
or "of Arundel." In short, the "Comes" really belongs
to the Christian name alone. The descriptive suffix is
distinct and immaterial. But the important inference
which I draw from the conclusion arrived at above is that
where we find such descriptive suffix employed, we may
gather that there was in existence at the time some other
earl or count with the same Christian name.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_463" id="Ref_463" href="#Foot_463">[463]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the earls, we look at once, but we look in vain,
for the name of Waleran of Meulan. But his half-brother,
William de Warenne, one, like himself, of the faithful
three,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_464" id="Ref_464" href="#Foot_464">[464]</a></span> duly figures at the head of the list. He is followed
by their brother-in-law, the Earl of Pembroke, whose
nephew and namesake, the Earl of Hertford, and brother,
Baldwin fitz Gilbert, are also found among the witnesses.
With them is another of the faithful three, Earl Simon of
Northampton. There too is Earl Alan of Richmond, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
the fortunate William of Albini, now Earl William of
Sussex. Robert of Ferrers and William of Aumâle, both
of them heroes of the Battle of the Standard, complete the
list of earls.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_465" id="Ref_465" href="#Foot_465">[465]</a></span></p>

<p>It would alone be sufficient to make this charter of
importance that it affords the earliest record evidence of
the existence of two famous earldoms, that of Hertford or
Clare, and that of Arundel or Sussex.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_466" id="Ref_466" href="#Foot_466">[466]</a></span> Indeed I know
of no earlier mention in any contemporary chronicler.
We further learn from it that William of Ypres was not
an earl at the time, as has been persistently stated. Nor
have I ever found a record in which he is so styled.
Lastly, we have here a noteworthy appearance of one
afterwards famous as Richard de Luci the Loyal, who was
destined to play so great a part as a faithful and trusted
minister for nearly forty years to come.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_467" id="Ref_467" href="#Foot_467">[467]</a></span> His appearance
as an attesting witness at least as early as this (Christmas,
1141) is a fact more especially deserving of notice because
it must affect the date of many other charters. Mr. Eyton
thought that "his earliest attestation yet proved is 1146,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_468" id="Ref_468" href="#Foot_468">[468]</a></span>
and hence found his name a difficulty, at times, as a
witness. William Martel was another official in constant
attendance on Stephen. He is described in the <i>Gesta</i>
(p. 92) as "vir illustris, fide quoque et amicitiâ potissimum
regi connexus." At the affair of Wilton, with its
disgraceful surprise and rout of the royal forces, he was
made prisoner and forced to give Sherborne Castle as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
price of his liberty (<i>ibid.</i>). By his wife "Albreda" he was
father of a son and heir, Geoffrey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_469" id="Ref_469" href="#Foot_469">[469]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the remaining witnesses, Pharamus (fitz William)
de Boulogne was <i>nepos</i> of the queen. In 1130 he was indebted
£20 to the Exchequer "pro placitis terre sue
[Surrey] et ut habeat terram suam quam Noverca sua
tenet" (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 31 Hen. I., p. 50). In the present
year (1141) he had been in joint charge of the king's
<i>familia</i> during his captivity:—"Rexit autem familiam
regis Stephani Willelmus d'Ipre, homo Flandrensis et
Pharamus nepos reginæ Matildis, et iste Bononiensis"
(<i>Sym. Dun.</i>, ii. 310). His ravages—"per destructionem
Faramusi"—are referred to in the Pipe-Roll of 1156 (p.
15), but he retained favour under Henry II., receiving £60
annually from the royal dues in Wendover and Eton.
In May, 1157, he attested, at Colchester, the charter of
Henry II. to Feversham Abbey (Stephen's foundation).
He held six fees of the honour of Boulogne. His grandfather,
Geoffrey, is described as a <i>nepos</i> of Eustace of
Boulogne. With his daughter and heiress Sibyl, his
lands passed to the family of Fiennes.</p>

<p>Robert de V(er) would be naturally taken for the
younger brother of Aubrey the chamberlain, slain in
1141.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_470" id="Ref_470" href="#Foot_470">[470]</a></span> This might seem so obvious that to question it
may appear strange. Yet there is reason to believe that
his identity was wholly different. I take him to be
Robert (fitz <i>Bernard</i>) de Vere, who is presumably the
"Robert de Vere" who figures as an Essex landowner in
the Pipe-Roll of 1130, for he is certainly the "Robert de
Vere" who is entered in that same roll as acquiring lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
in Kent, with his wife, for whom he had paid the Crown
£210, at that time a large sum. She was an heiress,
(sister of Robert and) daughter of Hugh de Montfort,
a considerable landowner in Kent and in the Eastern
Counties. With her he founded, on her Kentish estate,
the Cluniac priory of Monks Horton, and in the charters
relating to that priory he is spoken of as a royal constable.
As such he attested the Charter of Liberties
issued by Stephen at Oxford in 1136. I am therefore of
opinion that he is the witness who attests this Canterbury
charter, the Oxford charter of about a year later,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_471" id="Ref_471" href="#Foot_471">[471]</a></span>
and some others in the course of this reign.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_472" id="Ref_472" href="#Foot_472">[472]</a></span> He had
also witnessed some charters towards the close of the
preceding reign, and would seem to be the Robert de Ver
who was among those who took charge of the body of
Henry I. at his death.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_473" id="Ref_473" href="#Foot_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>Baldwin fitz Gilbert occurs repeatedly in the Pipe-Roll
of 31 Hen. I. He was a younger son of Gilbert de Clare,
a brother of Gilbert, afterwards Earl of Pembroke, and
uncle of Gilbert, Earl of Hertford. He appears, as early
as January, 1136, in attendance on Stephen, at Reading,
where he witnessed one of the charters to Miles of
Gloucester. He was then sent by the king into Wales to
avenge the death of his brother Richard (de Clare); but,
on reaching Brecknock, turned back in fear (<i>Gesta</i>, p. 12).
At the battle of Lincoln (February 2, 1141), he acted as
spokesman on the king's behalf, and was captured by
the forces of the Empress, after he had been covered with
wounds.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_474" id="Ref_474" href="#Foot_474">[474]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
Turgis of Avranches (the namesake of its bishop) we
have met with as a witness to Stephen's former charter
to Geoffrey. He seems to have been placed, on Geoffrey's
fall (1143), in charge of his castle of Walden, and, apparently,
of the whole property. Though Stephen had
raised him, it was said, from the ranks and loaded him
with favours, he ended by offering him resistance, but
was surprised by him, in the forest, when hunting, and
forced to surrender (<i>Gesta</i>, p. 110).</p>

<p>Passing now from the witnesses to the subject-matter
of the charter, we have first the clause replacing Geoffrey
in the same position as he was before the battle of Lincoln,
in despite of his treason to the king's cause. The
next clause illustrates the system of advancing bids.
Whereas the Empress had granted Geoffrey £100 a year,
charged on certain manors of royal demesne in Essex,
Stephen now increased that grant to £300 a year, by
adding the manors of Writtle (£120) and Hatfield (£80).
He further granted him another £100 a year payable
from lands which had escheated to the Crown. And
lastly, he granted to his son Ernulf £100 a year, likewise
charged on land.</p>

<p>The next clause grants him, precisely as in the charter
of the Empress, the constableship of the Tower of London
and of its appendant "castle,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_475" id="Ref_475" href="#Foot_475">[475]</a></span> with the exception that
the Empress uses the term "concedo" where Stephen
has "dedi et concessi." The latter expression is somewhat
strange in view of the fact that Geoffrey had been
in full possession of the Tower before the struggle had
begun, and, indeed, by hereditary right.</p>

<p>We then return to what I have termed the system of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
advancing bids. For where the Empress had granted
Geoffrey the office of justice and sheriff of Essex alone,
Stephen makes him justice and sheriff, not merely of
Essex, but of Herts and of London and Middlesex to boot.
Nor is even this all; for, whereas the Empress had allowed
him to hold Essex to farm for the same annual sum
which it had paid at her father's death,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_476" id="Ref_476" href="#Foot_476">[476]</a></span> Stephen now
leases it to him at the annual rent which his grandfather
had paid.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_477" id="Ref_477" href="#Foot_477">[477]</a></span> The fact that in the second charter of the
Empress she adopts, we shall find, the original rental,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_478" id="Ref_478" href="#Foot_478">[478]</a></span>
instead of, as before, that which was paid at the time of
her father's death, proves that, in this Canterbury
charter, Stephen had outbid her, and further proves that
Henry I. had increased, after his wont, the sum at which
the sheriff held Essex of the Crown. This, indeed, is
clear from the Pipe-Roll of 1130, which records a <i>firma</i>
far in excess of the £300 which, according to these
charters, Geoffrey's grandfather had paid.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_479" id="Ref_479" href="#Foot_479">[479]</a></span> It may be
noted that while Stephen's charter gives in actual figures
the "ferm" which had been paid by Geoffrey's grandfather,
and which Geoffrey himself was now to pay for
London and Middlesex, it merely provides, in the case of
Essex and Hertfordshire, that he was to pay what his
grandfather had paid, without mentioning what that sum
was. Happily, we obtain the information in the subsequent
charter of the Empress, and we are tempted to infer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
from the silence of this earlier charter on the point, that
while the ancient <i>firma</i> of London and Middlesex was a
sum familiar to men, that of Essex and Herts could only
be ascertained by research, pending which the Crown
declined to commit itself to the sum.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary that I should insist on the
extraordinary value of this statement and formal admission
by the Crown that London and Middlesex had been held
to farm by the elder Geoffrey de Mandeville—that is,
towards the close of the eleventh century, or, at latest, in
the beginning of the twelfth—and that the amount of the
<i>firma</i> was £300 a year. One cannot understand how
such a fact, of which the historical student cannot fail to
grasp the importance, can have been overlooked so long,
when it has virtually figured in Dugdale's <i>Baronage</i> for
more than two centuries. The only writer, so far as I
know, who has ventured on an estimate of the annual
render from London at the time of Domesday arrives at
the conclusion that "we can hardly be wrong in putting
the returns at ... about £850 a year."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_480" id="Ref_480" href="#Foot_480">[480]</a></span> We have seen
that, on the contrary, the rental, even later than Domesday,
was £300 a year, and this not for London only, but
for London and Middlesex together.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_481" id="Ref_481" href="#Foot_481">[481]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing, indeed, could show more plainly the necessity
for such a work as I have here undertaken, and the new
light which the evidence of these charters throws upon the
history of the time, than a comparison of the results
here obtained with the statements in Mr. Loftie's work,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_482" id="Ref_482" href="#Foot_482">[482]</a></span>
published under the editorship of Professor Freeman,
which, though far less inaccurate than his earlier and
larger work, contains such passages as this:—</p>

<p class="small"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
"Matilda had one chance of conciliating the citizens, and she
threw it away. The immemorial liberties which had been enjoyed
for generations, and confirmed by William and Henry, were taken
from the city, which for the first and last time in its history was put
'in demesne.' The Earl of Essex, Geoffrey de Mandeville, whose
father is said by Stow to have been portreeve, was given Middlesex
'in farm' with the Tower for his castle, and no person could hold
pleas either in city or county without his permission. The feelings
of the Londoners were fully roused. Though Stephen was actually a
prisoner, and Matilda's fortunes never seemed brighter, her cause was
lost.... The citizens soon saw that her putting them in demesne
was no mistake committed in a hasty moment in times of confusion,
but was part of a settled policy. This decided the waverers and
doubled the party of Stephen.... Stephen was exchanged for the
Earl of Gloucester, the Tower was surrendered, the dominion was
removed, and London had its liberty once more; but after such an
experience it is not wonderful that the citizens held loyally to Stephen
during the short remainder of his life" (pp. 36, 37).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_483" id="Ref_483" href="#Foot_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>A more complete travesty of history it would not be
possible to conceive. "The immemorial liberties" were
no older than the charter wrung from Henry a few years
before, and so far from the city being "put 'in demesne'"
(whatever may be meant by this expression),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_484" id="Ref_484" href="#Foot_484">[484]</a></span> "for the
first and last time in its history," the Empress, had she
done what is here charged to her, would have merely
placed Geoffrey in the shoes of his grandfather and namesake.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_485" id="Ref_485" href="#Foot_485">[485]</a></span>
But the strange thing is that she did nothing of
the kind, and that the facts, in Mr. Loftie's narrative, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
turned topsy-turvey. It was not by Matilda in June, but
by Stephen in December, that London and Middlesex
were placed in Geoffrey's power. The Empress did not do
that which she is stated to have done; and Stephen did
do what he is said to have undone. The result of his
return to power, so far as London was concerned, was that
the Tower was <i>not</i> surrendered, but, on the contrary, confirmed
to Geoffrey, and that so far from "the dominion"
(an unintelligible expression) being "removed," or London
regaining its liberty, it was now deprived of its liberty by
being placed, as even the Empress had refrained from
placing it, beneath the yoke of Geoffrey. Thus it was
certainly not due to his conduct on this occasion "that
the citizens of London held loyally to Stephen during the
short remainder of his life." Nor, it may be added, is it
possible to understand what is meant by that "short
remainder," for these events happened early in Stephen's
reign, not a third of which had elapsed at the time.</p>

<p>But the important point is this. Here was Stephen
anxious on the one hand to reward the Londoners for
their allegiance, and, on the other, to punish Geoffrey for
his repeated offences against himself, and yet compelled
by the force of circumstances actually to reward Geoffrey
at the cost of the Londoners themselves. We need no
more striking illustration of the commanding position and
overwhelming power which the ambitious earl had now
obtained by taking advantage of the rival claims, and
skilfully holding the balance between the two parties, as
was done by a later king-maker in the strife of Lancaster
and York.</p>

<p>Passing over for the present the remarkable expressions
which illustrate my theory of the differentiation of
the offices of justice and sheriff, I would invite attention
to Geoffrey's claim to be placed in the shoes of his grandfather,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
as an instance of the tendency, in this reign, of
the magnates to advance quasi-hereditary claims, often
involving, as it were, the undoing of the work of Henry I.
William de Beauchamp was anxious to be placed in the
shoes of Robert le Despenser; the Beaumont Earl of
Leicester in those of William Fitz Osbern; the Earl of
Oxford in those of William of Avranches; and Geoffrey
himself, we shall find, in those of "Eudo Dapifer."</p>

<p>A point of great importance awaits us in the reference
which, in this charter, is made to the Exchequer. I
expressed a doubt, when dealing with the first charter
of the Empress,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_486" id="Ref_486" href="#Foot_486">[486]</a></span> as to the supposed total extinction of
the working of the Exchequer under Stephen. The author
of the <i>Dialogus</i>, though anxious to emphasize its re-establishment
under Henry II., goes no further than to speak
of its system being "<i>pene</i> prorsus abolitam" in the terrible
time of the Anarchy (<small>I.</small> viii.). Now here, in 1141, at the
very height, one might say, of the Anarchy, we not only
find the Exchequer spoken of as in full existence, but,
which is most important to observe, we have the precise
Exchequer <i>formulæ</i> which we find under Henry II. The
"Terræ datæ," or alienated Crown demesnes, are represented
here by the "dominia que de predictis comitatibus
data sunt," and the provision that they should be subtracted
from the fixed ferm ("a firma subtrahantur")
is a formula found in use subsequently, as is, even more,
the phrase "ad scaccarium computabuntur."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_487" id="Ref_487" href="#Foot_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>The next clause deals with castles, that great feature
of the time. Here again the accepted view as to Stephen's
laxity on the subject is greatly modified by this evidence
that even Geoffrey de Mandeville, great as was his power,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
deemed it needful to secure the royal permission before
erecting a castle, and that this permission was limited
to a single fortress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_488" id="Ref_488" href="#Foot_488">[488]</a></span></p>

<p>In the next clause we return to the system of counter-bids.
As the king had trebled the grants of Crown
demesne made to Geoffrey by the Empress, and trebled
also the counties which had been placed in his charge
by her, so now he trebled the number of enfeoffed knights
("milites feudatos"). The Empress had granted twenty;
Stephen grants sixty. Of these sixty, ten were to be held
of Geoffrey by his son Ernulf. Here, as before,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_489" id="Ref_489" href="#Foot_489">[489]</a></span> the
question arises: what was the nature of the benefits thus
conferred on the grantee? They were, I think, of two
kinds. In the first place, Geoffrey became entitled to
what may be termed the feudal profits, such as reliefs,
accruing from these sixty fees. In the second, he secured
sixty knights to serve beneath his banner in war. This,
in a normal state of affairs, would have been of no
consequence, as he would only have led them to serve
the Crown. But in the then abnormal condition of affairs,
and utter weakness of the crown, such a grant would be
equivalent to strengthening <i>pro tanto</i> the power of the
earl as arbiter between the two rivals for the throne.</p>

<p>Independently, however, of its bearing at the time,
this grant has a special interest, as placing at our disposal
a list of sixty knights' fees, a quarter of a century older
than the "cartæ" of the <i>Liber Niger</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_490" id="Ref_490" href="#Foot_490">[490]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
At the close of all these specified grants comes a
general confirmation of the lost charter of the Queen
("Carta Regine").</p>

<p>Our ignorance of the actual contents of that charter
renders it difficult to speak positively as to whether
Geoffrey obtained from Stephen all the concessions he
had wrung from the Empress, or had to content himself,
on some points, with less, while on most he secured
infinitely more. Thus, in the matter of "the third penny,"
which was specially granted him by the Empress, we find
this charter of Stephen as silent as had been the former.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_491" id="Ref_491" href="#Foot_491">[491]</a></span>
And the omission of a clause authorizing the earl to
deduct it from the ferm of the county virtually implies
that he did not receive it. He gained, however, infinitely
more by the great reduction in the total ferm. The grant
by the Empress of a market at Bushey, and her permission
that the market at Newport should be transferred
to his castle at Walden, are not repeated in this charter;
nor does the king, as his rival had done, grant the earl
permission to fortify the Tower at his will, or to retain
and strengthen the castles he already possessed. On the
other hand, he allowed him, by a fresh concession, to
raise an additional stronghold. It may also be mentioned,
to complete the comparison, that the curious reference to
appeal of treason is not found in the king's charter.</p>

<p>We will now turn from this charter to the movements
by which it was followed.</p>

<p>At the close of the invaluable passage from Gervase
alluded to above, we read:—</p>

<p class="small">"Rex Stephanus a Cantuariâ recedens vires suas reparare studuit,
quo severius et acrius imperatricem et omnes ipsius complices debellaret."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_492" id="Ref_492" href="#Foot_492">[492]</a></span></p>

<p>His first step in this direction was to make a progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
through his realm, or at least through that portion over
which he reigned supreme. William of Malmesbury
writes of his movements after Christmas:—</p>

<p class="small">"Utræque partes imperatricis et regis se cum quietis modestiâ
egerunt a Natale usque ad Quadragesimam; magis sua custodire
quam aliena incursare studentes: rex in superiores regiones abscessit
nescio quæ compositurus" (p. 763).</p>

<p>This scrupulous reluctance of the writer to relate
events of which he had no personal knowledge is evidently
meant to confirm his assurance, just above, that he had
the greatest horror of so misleading posterity.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_493" id="Ref_493" href="#Foot_493">[493]</a></span> The
thread of the narrative, however, which he drops is taken
up by John of Hexham, who tells us that "after Easter"
(April 19) the king and queen arrived at York, put a
stop to a projected tournament between the two great
Yorkshire earls, and endeavoured to complete the preparations
for the king's revenge upon his foes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_494" id="Ref_494" href="#Foot_494">[494]</a></span></p>

<p>Before proceeding, I would call attention to two
charters which must, it seems, have passed between the
king's visit to Canterbury (Christmas, 1141), and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
appearance with the queen in Yorkshire (Easter, 1142).
I do so, firstly, because their witnesses ought to be compared
with those by whom the Canterbury charter was
attested; secondly, because one of them is a further
instance of how, as in the case of the Canterbury charter,
chronicles and charters may be made to confirm and
explain each other.</p>

<p>The first of these charters is the confirmation by
Stephen of the foundation, by his constable Robert de
Vere, of Monks Horton Priory, Kent.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_495" id="Ref_495" href="#Foot_495">[495]</a></span> If we eliminate
from its eleven witnesses those whose attendance was due
to the special contents of the charter, namely, the Count
of Eu and two Kentish barons,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_496" id="Ref_496" href="#Foot_496">[496]</a></span> there remain eight
names, every one of which appears in the Canterbury
charter, one as grantee and seven as witnesses. Here
is the list:</p>

<p>"Testibus Comite Gaufrido de Essex et Willelmo
Comite de Warrenne ... Et Comite Gilleberto de Penbroc
et Willelmo de Iprâ et Willelmo Mart[el] et Turgisio de
Abrincis et Ricardo de Luci et Adam de Belu[n] ... apud
Gipeswic."</p>

<p>Here then we have what might be described as King
Stephen's Restoration Court, or at least the greater
portion of its leading members; and this charter is therefore
evidence that Stephen must have visited the Eastern
Counties early in 1142. It is also evidence that Earl
Geoffrey was with him on that occasion, and thus throws
a gleam of light on the earl's movements at the time.</p>

<p>The other charter is known to us only from a transcript
in the Great Coucher (vol. ii. fol. 445), and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
strangely assigned in the official calendar to 1135-37.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_497" id="Ref_497" href="#Foot_497">[497]</a></span>
The grantee is William, Earl of Lincoln, and the list of
witnesses is as follows:—</p>

<p>"T. Com. Rann. et Com. Gisl. de Pembroc* et Com.
Gisl. de hertf.* et Com. Sim.* et Com. R. de Warwic' et
Com. R. de Ferr.* et W. mart.* et Bald. fil. Gisl.* et
W. fil. Gisl. et Ric. de Camvill et Ric. fil. Ursi* et
E[ustachio] fil. John' et Rad. de Haia et h' Wac' et W.
de Coleuill apud Stanf'."</p>

<p>Of these fifteen witnesses at least five are local men,
and of the remaining ten no fewer than seven (here distinguished
by an asterisk) had attested the Canterbury
charter. But further evidence of the close connection,
in date, between these two charters is found in yet another
quarter. This is the <i>English Chronicle</i>. We there read
that after the release of Stephen from his captivity, "the
king and Earl Randolf agreed at Stamford and swore
oaths and plighted troth, that neither of them should
prove traitor to the other." For this is the earliest
occasion to which that passage can refer. Stephen would
pass through Stamford on his northward progress to York,
and here, clearly, at his entrance into Lincolnshire, he was
met by the two local magnates, William, Earl of Lincoln,
and Randolf, Earl of Chester. Their revolt at Lincoln,
at the close of 1140, had led directly to his fall, but it
was absolutely needful for the schemes he had in view
that he should now secure their support, and overlook
their past treason. He therefore came to terms with the
two brother earls, and, further, bestowed on the Earl of
Lincoln the manor of Kirton-in-Lindsey ("Chircheton"),
and confirmed him in possession of his castle of Gainsborough
and his bridge over Trent, "libere et quiete
tenendum omnibus liberis consuetudinibus cum quibus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
aliquis comes Anglie tenet castella sua,"—a formula well
deserving attention as bearing on the two peculiar features
of this unhappy time, its earls and its castles.</p>

<p>Lastly, we should observe the family relationship
between the grantee and the witnesses of this charter.
The first witness was his half-brother, Earl Randolf of
Chester, who was uncle of Earl Gilbert of Hertford, who
was nephew of Earl Gilbert of Pembroke, who was brother
of W(alter) fitz Gilbert and Baldwin fitz Gilbert, of whom
the latter's daughter married H(ugh) Wac (Wake). Of
the other witnesses, Ralph de Haye was of the family
which then, and Richard de Camville of that which afterwards,
held the constableship of Lincoln Castle. Earl
R(oger) of Warwick (a supporter of the Empress) should
be noticed as an addition to the Canterbury list of earls,
and the descriptive style "de Warwicâ" may perhaps be
explained as inserted here to distinguish him from Earl
R(obert) "de Ferrers."</p>

<p>Gervase of Canterbury and John of Hexham alike lay
stress on the fact that the king, eager for revenge, was bent
on renewing the strife. William of Malmesbury echoes the
statement, but tells us that the king was struck down just
as he was about, we gather, to march south. As it was
at Northampton that this took place he must have been
following the very same road as he had done at this same
time of year in 1138.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_498" id="Ref_498" href="#Foot_498">[498]</a></span> Nor can we doubt that his objective
was Oxford, now again the head-quarters of his foe.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_499" id="Ref_499" href="#Foot_499">[499]</a></span> So
alarming was his illness that his death was rumoured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
and the forces he had gathered were dismissed to their
homes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_500" id="Ref_500" href="#Foot_500">[500]</a></span></p>

<p>But, meanwhile, where was Earl Geoffrey? We have
seen that early in the year he was present with Stephen
at Ipswich.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_501" id="Ref_501" href="#Foot_501">[501]</a></span> If we turn to the <i>Ely History</i>, printed in
Wharton's <i>Anglia Sacra</i>, we shall find evidence that he
was, shortly after, despatched with Earl Gilbert of
Pembroke, who had been with him at Ipswich, to Ely.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_502" id="Ref_502" href="#Foot_502">[502]</a></span>
When Stephen had successfully attacked Ely two years
before (1140), the bishop had fled, with three companions,
to the Empress at Gloucester. His scattered followers had
now reassembled, and it was to expel them from their
stronghold in the isle that Stephen despatched the two
earls. Geoffrey soon put them to flight, doubtless at
Aldreth, and setting his prisoners on horseback, with their
feet tied together, led them in triumph to Ely.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_503" id="Ref_503" href="#Foot_503">[503]</a></span> To the
monks, who came forth to meet him with their crosses
and reliquaries, he threatened plunder and death, and
their possessions were at once seized into the king's hands.
But, meanwhile, their bishop's envoy to the pope, "a man
skilled in the use of Latin, French, and English," had
returned from Rome with letters to the primates of
England and Normandy, insisting that Nigel should be
restored to his see. The monks, also, had approached
Stephen and obtained from him a reversal of Geoffrey's
violent action. Nigel, therefore, returned to Ely, to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
joy, we are told, of his monks and people; and the two
earls delivered into his hands the isle and Aldreth, its
key.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_504" id="Ref_504" href="#Foot_504">[504]</a></span></p>

<p>The point to insist upon, for our own purpose, is that
the Earls Geoffrey and Gilbert were both concerned in this
business, and that their names will again be found in
conjunction in the records of that intrigue with the Empress
which is the subject of the next chapter.</p>

a solemn assertion that the royal dignity had undergone no diminution"

"Meldona." This manor, and those which follow are the same, with
the addition of 'Inga' and 'Phingria,' as had been granted Geoffrey by the
Empress to make up his £100 a year. Thus these two manors represent
the "si quid defuerit ad <span class="smc">c</span> libratas perficiendas" of the Empress's charters.
Maldon itself had, we saw (p. 102), been held by Stephen's brother Theobald,
forfeited by the Empress on her triumph, and granted by her to Geoffrey.
Theobald's possession is further proved by a writ among the archives of
Westminster (printed in Madox's <i>Baronia Anglica</i>, p. 232), in which Stephen
distinctly states (1139) that he had given it him. Thus, in giving it to
Geoffrey, he had to despoil his own brother.</p>

But what is here granted is the manor of Springfield Hall, which William
de Boseville held of the honour of Peverel "of London," by the service of
two knights. Mathew Peverel, the Tresgoz family, and the Mauduits were
all tenants of the same honour.</p>

This same principle is well illustrated by two <i>cartæ</i> which follow one
another in the pages of the <i>Liber Niger</i>. They are those of "Willelmus
filius Johannis <i>de Herpetreu</i>" and "Willelmus filius Johannis <i>de Westona</i>."
Here the suffix (which in such cases is rather a crux to genealogists) clearly
distinguishes the two Williams, and is not the appellation of their respective
fathers (as it sometimes is). This leads us to such styles as "Beauchamp de
Somerset" and "Beauchamp de Warwick," "Willoughby d'Eresby" and
"Willoughby de Beke." Many similar instances are to be found in writs of
summons, and, applying the above principle, we see that, in all cases, the
suffix must originally have been added for the sake of distinction only.</p>

Of the absentees, the Earl of Chester and his half-brother the Earl of
Lincoln will be found accounted for below, as will also the Earl of Warwick;
the Earl of Leicester was absent, like his brother the Count of Meulan, but
he generally, as here, held aloof; the Earls of Gloucester, Cornwall, Devon,
and Hereford were, of course, with the Empress. Thus, with the nine
mentioned in the charter, we account for some eighteen earls.</p>

The two omitted portions amount to but a few lines. There is, however,
an error in each. The first implies that the charter to Geoffrey was
granted before the Empress reached, or was even invited to, London. The
second contains the erroneous statement that the Empress, on her flight from
London, "withdrew towards Winchester," and that her brother was captured
by the Londoners in pursuit, whereas he was not captured till after the siege
of Winchester, later in the year, and under different circumstances.</p>

"Post Pascha Stephanus, prosequente eum reginâ suâ Mathilde, venit

comite de Richemunt adversus alterutrum conductas solvit; habuitque
in votis pristinas suas injurias ultum ire, et regnum ad antiquam dignitatem
et integritatem reformare" (<i>Sym. Dun.</i>, ii. 312). Notice that John of Hexham
always speaks of Alan as Earl "of Richmond" and William as Earl "of
York." He is probably the first writer to speak of an Earl "of Richmond,"
and this early appearance of the title was clearly unknown to the Lords'
committee when they drew up their elaborate account of its origin and
descent (<i>Third Report on the Dignity of a Peer</i>). If, as I believe, no county
could, at this period, have two earls, it follows that either Alan "Comes"
did not hold an English earldom, and was merely described as of Richmond
because that was his seat; or, that "Richmondshire" was, at that time,
treated as a county of itself. One or other of these alternatives must, I
think, be adopted. But see also p. 290, <i>n.</i> 2.</p>

reach York till "post Pascha." William's chronology seems the more probable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<small>THE SECOND CHARTER OF THE EMPRESS.</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">We</span>
left, it may be remembered, the Empress and her
supporters assembled at Bristol, apparently towards the
close of the year 1141. Their movements are now somewhat
obscure, and the hopes of the Empress had been so
rudely shattered, that for a time her party were stunned
by the blow. We gather, however, from William of
Malmesbury that Oxford became her head-quarters,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_504b" id="Ref_504b" href="#Foot_504b">[504]</a></span> and
it was at Oxford that she granted the charter which forms
the subject of this chapter.</p>

<p>From internal evidence it is absolutely certain that this
charter is subsequent to that dealt with in the last chapter.
That is to say, it must be dated subsequent to Christmas,
1141. But it is also certain, from the fact that the Earl
of Gloucester is a witness, that it must have passed
previous to his departure from England at the end of
June, 1142.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_505" id="Ref_505" href="#Foot_505">[505]</a></span></p>

<p>It may, at first sight, excite surprise that, after having
extorted such concessions from Stephen, Geoffrey should
so quickly turn to his rival, more especially when Stephen
appeared triumphant, and the chances of his rival desperate.
But, on the one hand, in accordance with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
persistent policy, he hoped, by the offer of a fresh treason,
to secure from the Empress an even higher bid than that
which he had wrung from Stephen; and, on the other, the
very weakness of the Empress, he must have seen, would
place her more completely at his mercy. In short, he
now virtually aspired to the <i>rôle</i> of "the king-maker"
himself.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_506" id="Ref_506" href="#Foot_506">[506]</a></span></p>

<p>Even he, however, strong though he was, could scarcely
have attempted to stem the tide, while the flood of reaction
was at its height. He watched, no doubt, for the first
signs of an ebb in Stephen's triumph. It was not long
before this ebb came in the form of that illness by which
the king, as we saw, was struck down about the end of
April, on his way south, at Northampton.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_507" id="Ref_507" href="#Foot_507">[507]</a></span> The dismissal
of the host he had so eagerly collected was followed by a
rumour of his death.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_508" id="Ref_508" href="#Foot_508">[508]</a></span> No one, it would seem, has ever
noticed the strange parallel between this illness and that
of 1136. In each case it was about the end of April that
the king was thus seized, and in each case his seizure
gave rise to a widespread rumour of his death.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_509" id="Ref_509" href="#Foot_509">[509]</a></span> On the
previous occasion that rumour had been followed by an
outburst of treason and revolt,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_510" id="Ref_510" href="#Foot_510">[510]</a></span> and it is surely, to say the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
least, not improbable that it now gave the sign for which
Geoffrey was watching, and led to the extraordinary
charter with which we have here to deal.</p>

<p>The movements of the Empress have also to be considered
in their bearing on the date of the charter. We
learn from William of Malmesbury that she held two
councils at Devizes, one about the 1st of April (Mid-Lent),
and one at Whitsuntide (7-14 June). The latter council
was held on the return of the envoys who had been
despatched, after the former one, to request Geoffrey of
Anjou to come to his wife's assistance. Geoffrey had
replied that the Earl of Gloucester must first come over
to him, and the earl accordingly sailed from Wareham
about the end of June. It is most probable that he went
there straight from Devizes, in which case he was not
at Oxford after the beginning of June. In this case,
that is the latest date at which the charter can have
passed.</p>

<p>Although the original of this charter cannot, like its
predecessor of the previous year, be traced down to this
very day, we have the independent authorities of Dugdale
and of another transcriber for the fact that it was duly
recorded in the Great Coucher of the duchy.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_511" id="Ref_511" href="#Foot_511">[511]</a></span> If the missing
volume, or volumes, of that work should come to light,
I cannot entertain the slightest doubt that this charter
will be found there entered. Collateral evidence in its
favour is forthcoming from another quarter, for the record
with which, as I shall show, it is so closely connected that
the two form parts of one whole, has its existence proved
by cumulative independent evidence.</p>

<p>I have taken for my text, in this instance, the fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
transcript from the Great Coucher in <i>Lansd. MS.</i> 229 (fol.
109), with which I have collated Dugdale's transcript,
among his MSS. at Oxford (L. 19), "ex magno registro in
officio Ducatus Lancastrie." I have also collated another
transcript which is among the Dodsworth MSS. (xxx. 113),
and which was made in 1649. It is, unfortunately, incomplete.
Yet another transcriber began to copy the
charter, but stopped almost at once.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_512" id="Ref_512" href="#Foot_512">[512]</a></span> I have given in the
notes the variants (which are slight) in the Dodsworth
and Dugdale transcripts.</p>

<p class="center">"Sub magno sigillo dictæ Matildis Imperatricis."</p>

<p class="gap-above2">Let us now, in accordance with the guiding principle
on which I have throughout insisted, compare this charter
<i>seriatim</i> with those by which it was preceded, with a view
to ascertaining what further concessions the unscrupulous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
earl had won by this last change of front. We shall find
that, as we might expect, it marks a distinct advance.</p>

<p>The earlier clauses do little more than specifically confirm
the privileges and possessions that he had inherited
from his father or had already wrung from the eager rivals
for the Crown. This was by no means needless so far as
the Empress was concerned, for his desertion of her cause
since her previous charter involved, as an act of treason,
his forfeiture at her hands. These are followed by a new
grant, namely, "totam terram quæ fuit Eudonis Dapiferi in
Normannia et Dapiferatum ipsius," with a conditional
proposal that Geoffrey should also, in exchange for the
grants he had already received, obtain that portion of the
Dapifer's fief which lay in England. The large estate
which this successful minister had accumulated in the
service of the Conqueror and his sons had escheated to
the Crown at his death, and is entered accordingly in the
Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I. This has an important bearing on
the noteworthy admission in the charter that Geoffrey is
to receive the Dapifer's fief not as a gift, but as his right
("rectum suum"). This expression is referred to by Mr.
Eyton in his MSS., as placing beyond doubt the received
statement that Geoffrey was maternally a grandson of the
Dapifer, whose daughter and heiress Margaret had married
his father William. But this statement is taken from
Dugdale, who derived it solely from the <i>Historia Fundationis</i>
of St. John's Abbey, Colchester, a notoriously inaccurate
and untrustworthy document printed in the <i>Monasticon</i>.
The fact that this fief escheated to the Crown, instead of
passing to the Mandevilles with the Dapifer's alleged
daughter, is directly opposed to a story which has no
foundation of its own.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_557" id="Ref_557" href="#Foot_557">[557]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
The next clause to be noticed is that which refers to
Bishop's Stortford. It implies a peculiar antipathy to
this castle on the part of Earl Geoffrey, an antipathy
explained by the fact of its position, lying as it did on
the main road from London to (Saffron) Walden, and thus
cutting communications between his two strongholds. We
have a curious allusion to this episcopal castle a few years
before (1137), when Abbot Anselm of St. Edmund's,
who claimed to have been elected to the see, seized and
held it.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_558" id="Ref_558" href="#Foot_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<p>The next additional grant made in this charter is
that of "C libratas terræ de terris eschaetis et servicium
X militum" to the earl's son Ernulf. This is followed by
what is certainly the most striking clause in the whole
charter, that which binds the Empress and her husband "to
make no peace and come to no terms with the burgesses
(<i>sic</i>) of London, without the permission and assent of the
said Earl Geoffrey, because they are his mortal foes."
Comment on the character of such a pledge on the part of
one who claimed the crown, or on the light it throws on
Geoffrey's doings, is surely needless.</p>

<p>The clauses relating to Geoffrey's castles are deserving
of special attention on account of the important part
which the castle played in this great struggle. The
erection of unlicensed ("adulterine") castles and their
rapid multiplication throughout the land is one of the
most notorious features of the strife, and one for which
Stephen's weakness has been always held responsible. It
is evident, however, from these charters that the Crown
struggled hard against the abdication of its right to control
the building of castles, and that even when reduced
to sore straits, both Stephen and the Empress made this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
privilege the subject of special and limited grant. By this
charter the earl secures the license of the Empress for a
new castle which he had erected on the Lea. He may have
built it to secure for himself the passage of the river, it
being for him a vital necessity to maintain communication
between the Tower of London and his ancestral stronghold
in Essex. But the remainder of the passage involves a
doubt. The Empress professes to repeat the permission in
her former charter that he may construct one permanent
castle, in addition to those he has already, anywhere
within his fief. Yet a careful comparison of this permission
with that contained in her former charter, and
that which was granted by Stephen, in his charter between
the two, proves that she was really confirming what he,
not she, had granted.</p>

<p>As we can trace, in every other instance, the relation
of the various charters without difficulty or question, it
would seem that we have here to do with an error, whether
or not intentional.</p>

<p>We then come to the clauses in favour of Geoffrey's
relatives and friends. This is a novel feature which we
cannot afford to overlook. It is directly connected with
the question of that important De Vere charter to which
we shall shortly come.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the remarkable arrangement for
securing the validity of the charter. Let us look at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
closely.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_559" id="Ref_559" href="#Foot_559">[559]</a></span> We should first notice that the Empress describes
it, not as a charter, but as a "convencio et donatio."
Now this "convencio" is a striking term, for it virtually
denotes a treaty between two contracting powers. This
conception of treaty relations between the Crown and its
subjects is one of the marked peculiarities of this singular
reign. It is clearly foreshadowed in those noteworthy
charters which the powerful Miles of Gloucester secured
from Stephen at his accession, and it meets us again in
the negotiations between the youthful Henry of Anjou,
posing as the heir to the crown, and the great nobles,
towards the close of this same reign. It is in strict
accordance with this idea that we here find the Empress
naming those who were to be her sureties for her
observance of this "convencio," precisely as was done in
the case of a treaty between sovereign powers.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_560" id="Ref_560" href="#Foot_560">[560]</a></span> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
exact part which the King of France was to play in this
transaction is not as clear as could be wished, but the
expression "capere in manu" is of course equivalent to
his becoming her "manucaptor," and "tenere" is here
used in the sense of "to hold good."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_561" id="Ref_561" href="#Foot_561">[561]</a></span> The closing words
in which "the Lady of England" declared that all the
Church of Christ then beneath her sway shall undertake
to be responsible for her keeping faith, present a striking
picture: but yet more vivid, in its dramatic intensity, is
that of the undaunted Empress, the would-be Queen of the
English, standing in her water-girdled citadel, surrounded
by her faithful followers, and playing, as it were, her last
card, as she placed her hand, in token of her faith, in the
grip of the Iron Earl.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_562" id="Ref_562" href="#Foot_562">[562]</a></span></p>

<p>It was only, indeed, the collapse, to all appearance, of
her fortunes, that could have tempted Geoffrey to demand,
or have induced the Empress to concede, terms so preposterously
high. The fact that she was hoping, at this
moment, to allure her husband to her side, that he might
join her in a crowning effort, explains her eagerness to
secure allies, at the cost of whatever sacrifice, and also, in
consequence, the anxiety of those allies to bind her to her
promises hard and fast. It further throws light on the
constant reference throughout this charter to Geoffrey of
Anjou and his son.</p>

<p>Turning to the names of her proposed sureties, we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
among them five earls, of whom the Earls of Norfolk and
of Pembroke invite special notice. The former had played
a shifty part from the very beginning of the reign. He
appears to have really fought for his own hand alone, and
we find him, the year after this, joining the Earl of Essex
in his wild outburst of revolt. With Pembroke the case
was different. He had been among the nobles who, the
Christmas before, had assembled at Stephen's court, and
had attested the charter there granted to the Earl of
Essex. He may, in the interval, have quarrelled with
Stephen and joined the party of the Empress; but I think
the occurrence of his name may be referred, with more
probability, to another cause, that of his family ties. It is,
indeed, to family ties that we must now turn our attention.</p>

<p>The Earl of Essex had included, as we have seen, in
his demands on this occasion, provisions in favour of
certain of his relatives, including apparently his sisters'
husbands. But these by no means exhausted the concessions
he had resolved to exact. He had come prepared
to offer the Empress the support, not only of himself, but
of a powerful kinsman and ally. This was his wife's
brother, Aubrey de Vere.</p>

<p>It will be better to relegate to an appendix the relationship
of these two families, without a clear understanding
of which it is impossible to grasp Geoffrey's scheme, or to
interpret aright these charters in their relation to one
another, and in their bearing as parts of a connected whole.
Unfortunately, the errors of past genealogists have rendered
it a task of some difficulty to ascertain the correct pedigree.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_563" id="Ref_563" href="#Foot_563">[563]</a></span></p>

<p>When the fact has been established on a sure footing
that Aubrey stood in the relation of wife's brother to
Geoffrey, we may turn to the charter upon which my
narrative is here founded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
This is a charter of the Empress to Aubrey at
Oxford. Mr. Eyton had, of course, devoted his attention
to this, as to the other charters, in his special studies on
the subject, but his fatal mistake in assigning both this
and the above charter to Geoffrey to the year 1141
deprives his conclusions of all value. We may note, however,
that he argued from the mention, in the charter
granted to Geoffrey, of "Earl Aubrey," that it must, in
any case, be subsequent to the charter by which Aubrey
was created an earl. He, therefore, dated the latter as
"<i>circ.</i> July, 1141," and the former "<i>circ.</i> August, 1141"
(or "between July 25 and Aug. 15, 1141").<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_564" id="Ref_564" href="#Foot_564">[564]</a></span> This reasoning
could at once be disposed of by pointing out that the
Empress accepted her new ally and supporter as "Earl
Aubrey" already. Of this, however, more below. But
the true answer is to be found in the fact, which Mr.
Eyton failed to perceive, that these two charters were not
only granted simultaneously, but formed the two complements
of one connected whole. In the light of this
discovery the whole episode is clear.</p>

<p>It is now time to give the charter with the grounds for
believing in its existence and authenticity. We have two
independent transcripts to work from. One of them was
taken from the Vere register by Vincent in 1622, and
printed by him in his curious <i>Discoverie of Brook's Errors</i>.
The other was taken, apparently, in 1621, and was used
by Dugdale for his <i>Baronage</i>. Vincent's original transcript
is preserved at the College of Arms, and this I have
used for the text. But we have, fortunately, strong external
testimony to the existence of the actual document. There
is printed in Rymer's <i>Fœdera</i> (xiii. 251) a confirmation by
Henry VIII. (May 6, 1509) of this very charter, in which
he is careful to state that it was duly exhibited before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
him.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_565" id="Ref_565" href="#Foot_565">[565]</a></span> Thus, from an unexpected source we obtain the
evidence we want. It must further be remembered that
our knowledge of these twin charters comes from two
different and unconnected quarters, one being recorded in
the duchy coucher (see p. 165), while the other was found
among the muniments of the heir of the original grantee
(see p. 183). If, then, these two independent documents
confirm and explain one another, there is every reason to
believe that their contents are wholly authentic.</p>

<p>Putting together these passages with the fact that the
witnesses also are the same in both charters, we see
plainly that these two documents, while differing from all
others of the kind, correspond precisely with each other.
Above all, we note that it was to Geoffrey, not to Aubrey,
that the Empress pledged her faith for the fulfilment of
Aubrey's charter. This shows, as I observed, that Aubrey
obtained this charter as Geoffrey's relative and ally, just
as Geoffrey's less important kinsmen were provided for
in his own charter.</p>

<p>Here we may pause for a moment, before examining
this record in detail, to glance at another which forms its
corollary and complement.</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that in both these charters
the Empress undertook to obtain their confirmation by her
husband and her son. We know not whether the charter
to Geoffrey was so confirmed, but presumably it was.
For, happily, in the case of its sister-charter, the confirmation
by the youthful Henry was preserved. And
there is every reason to believe that when this was confirmed
the other would be confirmed also.</p>

<p>The confirmation by the future King Henry II. of his
mother's charter to Aubrey de Vere may be assigned
to July-November, 1142. His uncle Robert crossed to
Normandy shortly after witnessing the original charter,
and returned to England, accompanied by his nephew,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
about the end of December.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_581" id="Ref_581" href="#Foot_581">[581]</a></span> We may assume that no
time was lost in obtaining the confirmation by the youthful
heir, and though the names of the witnesses and the place
of testing are, unluckily, omitted in the transcript, the
fact that a Hugh "de Juga" acted as Geoffrey's proxy
for the occasion supports the hypothesis that the confirmation
took place over sea. That we have a confirmation
by Henry, but not by his father, is doubtless due to
Geoffrey of Anjou refusing, on this occasion, to come to
his wife's assistance, and virtually, by sending his son in
his stead, abdicating in his favour whatever pretensions
he had to the English throne.</p>

<p>As Henry's charter is printed at the foot of his
mother's by Vincent, I shall content myself with quoting
its distinctive features, for the subject matter is the same
except for some verbal differences.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_582" id="Ref_582" href="#Foot_582">[582]</a></span> There is some confusion
as to the authority for its text. Vincent transcribed
it, like that of the Empress, from the Hedingham
Castle Register. Dugdale, in his <i>Baronage</i>, mixes it up
with the charter granted by Henry when king, so that
his marginal reference would seem to apply to the latter.
In his MSS., however, he gives as his authority "Autographum
in custodia Johis. Tindall unius magror.
Curie cancellarie temp. Reg. Eliz." If the original
charter itself was in existence so late as this there is
just a hope that it may yet be found in some unexplored
collection. From time to time such "finds" are made,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_583" id="Ref_583" href="#Foot_583">[583]</a></span>
and few discoveries would be more welcome than that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
the earliest charter of one of the greatest sovereigns who
have ever ruled these realms, the first Plantagenet king.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p class="gap-above2">Henry "fitz Empress" was at this time only nine and
a half years old. The claim he is here made to advance
as "rightful heir" of England and Normandy sounds the
key-note of the coming struggle. Not only till he had
obtained the crown, but also after he had obtained it,
he steadily dwelt on his "right" to the throne, of which
Stephen had wrongfully deprived him.</p>

<p>We should also note that he claims to be "heir" of
England and Normandy, but not of Anjou. I take this
to imply that he posed as no mere heir-expectant, but
as one who ought, by right, to be in actual possession of
his realm. He could not, in the lifetime of his father,
assume this attitude to Anjou. Hence its omission. As
for his mother, he seems, from the first, to have claimed
her inheritance, as he eventually obtained it, not for her,
but for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
Let us now return to the charter of the Empress.</p>

<p>It will be best to discuss its successive clauses <i>seriatim</i>.
The opening portion, from "Sciatis me reddidisse" to
"sicut alia Carta mea quam inde habuit testatur," is
merely a confirmation of her previous charter, granted,
as we learn from this, for the purpose of securing him
in the possession of his father's fief and office of royal
chamberlain. His father, who is said to have been slain
in May, 1141, had been granted the chamberlainship by
Henry I. in 1133, the charter being printed by Madox from
Dugdale's transcript. This confirmation repeats its terms.</p>

<p>The next portion extends from the words "Et do et
concedo" to "sicut Carta sua alia quam inde habet
testatur." About this there is some obscurity. The
word is "do," not "<i>red</i>do," and the expression "Carta
sua" replaces "Carta mea." The clause clearly refers
to grants made to Aubrey himself since his father's death,
but whether by the king or by the Empress is not so
clear as could be wished. The point need not be discussed
at length, but the former seems the more probable.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is no such doubt about the clauses
of creation. Here the question of the formula becomes
all-important. The case stands thus. There are only
two instances in the course of this reign in which we can
be quite certain that we are dealing with creations <i>de novo</i>.
The one is that by which the king "made" Geoffrey Earl
of Essex; the other, that by which the Empress "made"
Miles Earl of Hereford. We know that neither grantee
had been created an earl before; and we find that the
sovereign, in each instance, speaks of having "made"
("fecisse") him an earl.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_586" id="Ref_586" href="#Foot_586">[586]</a></span> So, again, in the only instance
of a "counter-patent" of creation, of which we can be quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
certain, namely, that by which the Empress recognized
Geoffrey as Earl of Essex after he had received that title
from Stephen, the formula used is: "Do et concedo ut sit
Comes." The two are essentially distinct. Now, applying
this principle to the present charter, we find the latter of
the two <i>formulæ</i> employed on this occasion. The words
are: "Do ei et concedo ut sit Comes." We infer, therefore,
if my view be right, that Aubrey was already in
enjoyment of comital rank when he received this charter.
It might be, and indeed has been, supposed that he was
so by virtue of a creation by Stephen. I have noted an
instance in which he attests a charter of Stephen (at the
siege of Wallingford) as a "comes,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_587" id="Ref_587" href="#Foot_587">[587]</a></span> and it is not likely
that Stephen would allow him this title in virtue of a
creation by the Empress. On the other hand, in this
charter the Empress treats him as already a <i>comes</i>, which
she does not do in the case of Geoffrey, who had been
created a <i>comes</i> by Stephen.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_588" id="Ref_588" href="#Foot_588">[588]</a></span> The difference between the
two cases is accounted for by the fact that Aubrey was <i>comes</i>
not by a creation of Stephen, but in right of his wife
Beatrice, heiress of the <i>Comté</i> of Guisnes. This has been
clearly explained by Mr. Stapleton in his paper on "The
Barony of William of Arques,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_589" id="Ref_589" href="#Foot_589">[589]</a></span> although he is mistaken
in his dates. He wrongly thought, like others, that
Aubrey's father, the chamberlain, was killed in May, 1140,
instead of May, 1141, and, like Mr. Eyton, he wrongly
assigned this charter of the empress to 1141, instead of
1142.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
Aubrey de Vere may be supplemented by a reference to
the fact that "the blue <i>boar</i>" was the badge of the family
through a pun on the Latin <i>verres</i>.</p>

<p>Aubrey was already the husband of Beatrice, the heiress
of Guisnes, at the death of her grandfather Count Manasses
(? 1139). He thereupon went to Flanders and became
(says Lambart d'Ardes) Count of Guisnes. Returning to
England, he sought and obtained from Stephen his wife's
English inheritance and executed, as Mr. Stapleton
observes, in his father's lifetime (<i>i.e.</i> before May, 1141),
the charter printed in Morant's <i>Essex</i> (ii. 506). Aubrey
was divorced from Beatrice a few years later, when she
married (between 1144 and 1146, thinks Mr. Stapleton)
Baldwin d'Ardres, the claimant of Guisnes. Thus did
Aubrey come to be for a time "Count of Guisnes," as
recorded, according to Weever, on his tomb at Colne
Priory.</p>

<p>Mr. Stapleton was unable to produce any English
record or chronicle in which Aubrey is given the style of
"Count of Guisnes." It is, therefore, with much satisfaction
that I print, from the original charter, the following
record, conclusively establishing that he actually had that
style:—</p>

<p class="gap-above2">But, to return to Maud's charter, the point which I
am anxious to emphasize is that of the formula she
employs, namely, "do et concedo," as against the "sciatis
me fecisse" of an original creation. I trace this distinction
in later years, when her son, who had already, as we
have seen, confirmed this charter to Aubrey, again confirmed
it when king (1156), employing for that purpose
the same formula: "Sciatis me dedisse et concessisse
comiti Alberico." Conversely, in the case of Hugh Bigod,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
he employs the formula: "Sciatis me fecisse Hugonem
Bigot comitem de Norfolca" (1155), this being an earldom
of Stephen's creation, and, so far as we know, of his alone.
This is a view which should be accepted with caution, but
which has, if correct, an important bearing.</p>

<p>The very remarkable shifting clause as to the county
of which the grantee should be earl requires separate
notice. The axiom from which I start is this: When a
feudatory was created an earl, he took if he could for
his "comitatus" the county in which was situated the
chief seat of his power, his "Caput Baroniæ." If this
county had an earl already he then took the nearest
county that remained available. Thus Norfolk fell to
Bigod, Essex to Mandeville, Sussex to Albini, Derby to
Ferrers, and so on. De Clare, the seat of whose power
was in Suffolk, though closely adjoining Essex, took Herts,
probably for the reason that Mandeville had already
obtained Essex, while Bigod's province, being in truth the
old earldom of the East Angles—"Comes de Estangle," as
Henry of Huntingdon terms him,—took in Suffolk. So
now, Aubrey de Vere probably selected Cambridgeshire as
the nearest available county to his stronghold at Castle
Hedingham.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_592" id="Ref_592" href="#Foot_592">[592]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Empress, we see, promised it only on the
strange condition that her uncle was not already in
possession. I say "the strange condition," for one would
surely have thought that she knew whether he was or
not. Moreover, the dignity was then held not by her
uncle, but by his son, and is described as the earldom of
Huntingdon, never as the earldom of Cambridge. The
first of these difficulties is explained by the fact that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
King of Scots had, early in the reign, made over the
earldom to his son Henry, to avoid becoming himself the
"man" of the King of England. The second requires
special notice.</p>

<p>We are taken back, by this provision, to the days
before the Conquest. Mr. Freeman, in his erudite essay
on <i>The Great Earldoms under Eadward</i>, has traced the
shifting relations of the counties of Northamptonshire,
Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, and Northumberland.
The point, however, which concerns us here is that,
"under William," Earl Waltheof, "besides his great
Northumbrian government, was certainly Earl of Northamptonshire
(<i>Ord. Vit.</i>, 522 C.), and of Huntingdonshire
(<i>Will. Gem.</i>, viii. 37)."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_593" id="Ref_593" href="#Foot_593">[593]</a></span> His daughter Matilda
married twice, and between the heirs of these two marriages
the contest for her father's inheritance was obstinate
and long. Restricting ourselves to his southern
province, with which alone we have here to deal, its
western half, the county of Northampton, had at this
time passed to Simon of St. Liz as the heir of the first
marriage, while Huntingdon had conferred an earldom on
Henry, the heir of her marriage with the Scottish king.
The house of St. Liz, however, claimed the whole inheritance,
and as the Earl of Huntingdon, of course,
sided with his cousin, the Empress, Earl Simon of
Northampton was the steadfast supporter, even in their
darkest hours, of Stephen and his queen. Now, the
question that arises is this: Was not Earl Henry's province
Huntingdonshire <i>with</i> Cambridgeshire? Mr. Freeman
writes of Huntingdonshire, that "in 1051 we find it,
together with Cambridgeshire, a shire still so closely
connected with it as to have a common sheriff, detached
altogether from Mercia," etc.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_594" id="Ref_594" href="#Foot_594">[594]</a></span> It is true that when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
former county became "an outlying portion of the
earldom of Northumberland," it does not, he observes,
"appear that Cambridgeshire followed it in this last
migration;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_595" id="Ref_595" href="#Foot_595">[595]</a></span> but when we compare this earlier connection
with that in the Pipe-Roll of 1130,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_596" id="Ref_596" href="#Foot_596">[596]</a></span> and with the fact
that under another David of Scotland, this earldom, some
seventy years later, appears as that of Huntingdon and
Cambridge,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_597" id="Ref_597" href="#Foot_597">[597]</a></span> we shall find in this charter a connecting
link, which favours the view that the two counties had,
for comital purposes, formed one throughout. We have
a notable parallel in the adjacent counties of Norfolk and
Suffolk, which still formed one, the East Anglian earldom.
Dorset and Somerset, too, which were under one
sheriff, may have been also intended to form one
earldom, for the Lord of Dunster is found both as Earl
of "Dorset" and of "Somerset." I suspect also that
the Ferrers earldom was, in truth, that of the joint
shrievalty of Derbyshire and Notts, and that this is why
the latter county was never made a separate earldom till
the days of Richard II.</p>

<p>The doubt of the Empress must therefore be attributed
to her anxiety not to invade the comital rights of her
cousin, in case he should deem that her creation of an
earldom of Cambridgeshire would constitute such invasion.
It is evident, we shall find, that he did so. The
accepted view is, it would appear, that Aubrey, by virtue
of this charter, became Earl "of Cambridge."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_598" id="Ref_598" href="#Foot_598">[598]</a></span> Mr.
Doyle, indeed, in his great work, goes so far as to state
that he was "cr. Earl of <span class="smc">Cambridge</span> by the Empress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
Maud (after March 2) 1141; ... cr. Earl of <span class="smc">Oxford</span> (<i>in
exchange</i>) 1155."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_599" id="Ref_599" href="#Foot_599">[599]</a></span> But in Cole's (unpublished) transcript
of the Colne Cartulary (fols. 34, 37), we have a charter
of this Aubrey, "Pro animâ patris mei Alberici de Vere,"
which must have passed between 1141 and 1147, for it is
attested by Robert, Bishop of London, appointed 1141,
and Hugh, Abbot of Colchester, who died in 1147. In
this charter his style is "Albericus Comes Oxeneford."
Here, then, we have evidence that, in this reign, he was
already Earl "of Oxford," not Earl of Cambridge.</p>

<p>Before quitting the subject of Aubrey's creation, we
may note the bearing of the shifting clause on the creation
of the earldom of Wiltshire. It implies that Patrick of
Salisbury had not yet received his earldom. This conclusion
is confirmed by a charter of the Empress tested
at Devizes, which he witnesses merely as "Patricio de
Sarum conestabulo."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_600" id="Ref_600" href="#Foot_600">[600]</a></span> The choice of Dorset is somewhat
singular, as it suggests an intrusion on the Mohun earldom.
But this rather shadowy dignity appears, during its
brief existence, as an earldom of Somerset rather than of
Dorset.</p>

<p>The specific grant of the "tertius denarius," as in the
creation charters of the earldoms of Essex and of Hereford,
should also be noticed.</p>

<p>The "Earl Gilbert" who is repeatedly mentioned in
the course of this charter is Earl Gilbert "of Pembroke,"
maternal uncle to Aubrey. It is this relationship that,
perhaps, accounts for the part he here plays.</p>

<p>Of the remaining features of interest in the record,
attention may be directed to the phrase concerning the
knights' fees of William de Helion: "Ut ipse Willelmus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
teneat de Comite Alberico, et ipse Comes faciat inde michi
servitium;" also to the implied forfeiture of William
Peverel of Nottingham, he having been made prisoner at
Lincoln, fighting on Stephen's side. Lastly, the promise
to the earl of the chancellorship for his brother William
becomes full of interest when we know that this was the
Canon of St. Osyth,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_601" id="Ref_601" href="#Foot_601">[601]</a></span> and that he was to be thus rewarded
as being the clerical member of his house. It enables
us further to identify in William, the existing chancellor,
the brother of John (fitz Gilbert) the marshal.</p>

<p>We have now examined these two charters, parts, I
would again insist, of one connected negotiation. What
was its object? Nothing less, in my opinion, than a
combined revolt in the Eastern Counties which should
take Stephen in the rear, as soon as the arrival from
Normandy of Geoffrey of Anjou and his son should give
the signal for a renewal of the struggle, and a fresh advance
upon London by the forces of the west country.
Earl Geoffrey himself was now at the height of his power.
If he were supported by Aubrey de Vere, and by Henry of
Essex with Peter de Valoines (who are specially named in
Geoffrey's charter), he would be virtually master of Essex.
And if the restless Earl of the East Angles (p. 178 <i>supra</i>)
would also join him, as eventually he did, while Bishop
Nigel held Ely, Stephen would indeed be placed between
two fires. I cannot but think that it is to the rumour
of some such scheme as this that Stephen's panegyrist
refers, when he tells us, the following year, that Geoffrey
"had arranged to betray the realm into the hands of the
Countess of Anjou, and that his intention to do so had
been matter of common knowledge."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_602" id="Ref_602" href="#Foot_602">[602]</a></span></p>

<p>I would urge that in the charters I have given above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
we find the key to this allusion, and that they, in their
turn, are explained, and at the same time confirmed, by
the existence of this concerted plot. We have now to trace
the failure of the scheme, and to learn how it was that
all came to nought.</p>

<p>Stephen's illness, to which, it may be remembered, I
had attributed in part the inception of the scheme, only
lasted till the middle of June. By the time that Robert
of Gloucester had set forth to cross the Channel, Stephen
was restored to health, and ready and eager for action.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_603" id="Ref_603" href="#Foot_603">[603]</a></span>
Swift to seize on such an opportunity as he had never
before obtained, he burst into the heart of the enemy's
country and marched straight on Wareham. He found
its defenders off their guard; the town was sacked and
burnt, and the castle was quickly his.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_604" id="Ref_604" href="#Foot_604">[604]</a></span> The precautions
of the Earl of Gloucester had thus been taken in vain,
and the port he had secured for his return was now
garrisoned by the king.</p>

<p>The effect of this brilliant stroke was to paralyze the
party of the Empress. Her brother, who had left her with
great reluctance, dreading the fickleness of the nobles, had
made her assembled supporters swear that they would
defend her in his absence, and had further taken with him
hostages for their faithful behaviour.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_605" id="Ref_605" href="#Foot_605">[605]</a></span> He had also so
strengthened her defences at Oxford that the city seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
almost impregnable.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_606" id="Ref_606" href="#Foot_606">[606]</a></span> Lastly, a series of outlying posts
secured the communications of its defenders with the
districts friendly to their cause.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_607" id="Ref_607" href="#Foot_607">[607]</a></span></p>

<p>But Stephen, in the words of his panegyrist, had
"awaked as one out of sleep." Summoning to his
standard his friends and supporters, he marched on
Gloucestershire itself, and appeared unexpectedly at
Cirencester on the line of the enemy's communications.
Its castle, taken by surprise, was burnt and razed to the
ground. Then, completing the isolation of the Empress, by
storming, as he advanced, other of her posts,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_608" id="Ref_608" href="#Foot_608">[608]</a></span> he arrived
before the walls of Oxford on the 26th of September.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_609" id="Ref_609" href="#Foot_609">[609]</a></span> The
forces of the Empress at once deployed on the left bank of
the river. The action which followed was a curious
anticipation of the struggle at Boyne Water (1690). The
king, informed of the existence of a ford, boldly plunged
into the water, and, half fording, half swimming, was one
of the first to reach the shore. Instantly charging the
enemy's line, he forced the portion opposed to him back
towards the walls of the city, and when the bulk of his
forces had followed him across, the whole line was put to
flight, his victorious troops entering the gates pell-mell
with the routed fugitives. The torch was as familiar as
the sword to the soldier of the Norman age, and Oxford
was quickly buried in a sheet of smoke and fire.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_610" id="Ref_610" href="#Foot_610">[610]</a></span> The
castle, then of great strength, alone held out. From the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
summit of its mound the Empress must have witnessed the
rout of her followers; within its walls she was now
destined to stand a weary siege.</p>

<p>It is probable that Stephen's success at Oxford was
in part owing to the desertion of the Empress by those
who had sworn to defend her. For we read that they
were led by shame to talk of advancing to her relief.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_611" id="Ref_611" href="#Foot_611">[611]</a></span>
The project, however, came to nothing, and Earl Robert,
hearing of the critical state of affairs, became eager to
return to the assistance of his sister and her beleaguered
followers.</p>

<p>Geoffrey of Anjou had, on various pretences, detained
the earl in Normandy, instead of accepting his invitation
and returning with him to England. But Robert's
patience was now exhausted, and, bringing with him,
instead of Geoffrey, the youthful Henry "fitz Empress,"
he sailed for England with a fleet of more than fifty ships.
Such was the first visit to this land of the future Henry II.,
being then nine years and a half, not (as stated by Dr.
Stubbs) eight years old.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_612" id="Ref_612" href="#Foot_612">[612]</a></span></p>

<p>The earl made it a point of honour to recapture Wareham
as his first step. He also hoped to create a diversion
which might draw off the king from Oxford.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_613" id="Ref_613" href="#Foot_613">[613]</a></span> This was
not bad strategy, for Stephen was deemed to be stronger
behind the walls of Oxford than he would be in the open
country. The position of affairs resembled, in fact, that
at Winchester, the year before. But the two sides had
changed places. As the Empress, in Winchester, had
besieged Wolvesey, so now, in Oxford, Stephen did the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
same. It would, therefore, have been necessary to besiege
him in turn as the Empress was besieged the year before.
Well aware of the advantage he enjoyed, Stephen refused
to be decoyed away, and allowed the castle of Wareham
to fall into Robert's hands. The other posts in the neighbourhood
were also secured by the earl, who then advanced
to Cirencester, where he had summoned his friends to
meet him. Thus strengthened, he was already marching
to the relief of Oxford, when he received the news of his
sister's perilous escape and flight. A close siege of three
months had brought her to the extremity of want, and
Stephen was pressing the attack with all the artillery of
the time. A few days before Christmas, in a long and
hard frost, when the snow was thick upon the ground, she
was let down by ropes from the grim Norman tower,
which commanded the approach to the castle on the side
of the river. Clad in white from head to foot, and escorted
by only three knights, she succeeded under cover of the
darkness of night, and by the connivance of one of the
besiegers' sentries, in passing through their lines undetected
and crossing the frozen river. After journeying
on foot for six miles, she reached the spot where horses
were in waiting, and rode for Wallingford Castle, her still
unconquered stronghold.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_614" id="Ref_614" href="#Foot_614">[614]</a></span></p>

<p>On receiving the news of this event Robert changed
his course, and proceeded to join his sister. In her joy
at the return of her brother and the safe arrival of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
son, the Empress forgot all her troubles. She was also
in safety now, herself, behind the walls of Wallingford,
the support of that town and its fidelity to her cause
being gratefully acknowledged by her son on his eventual
accession to the throne.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_615" id="Ref_615" href="#Foot_615">[615]</a></span></p>

<p>But her husband had declined to come to her help;
her city of Oxford was lost; her <i>prestige</i> had suffered a
final blow; the great combination scheme was at an
end.</p>

William fitz Otwel, Earl Geoffrey's "brother," is referred to by Earl
William (Geoffrey's son) as his uncle ("avunculus") in a charter confirming
his grant of lands (thirty-three acres) in "Abi et Toresbi" to Greenfield
Nunnery, Lincolnshire (<i>Harl. Cart.</i>, 53, C, 50). He is also a witness, as
"patruus meus," to a charter of Earl Geoffrey the younger (<i>Sloane Cart.</i>,
xxxii. 64), early in the reign of Henry II. He was clearly a "uterine"
brother of Earl Geoffrey the elder, so that his father must have married
William de Mandeville's widow—a fact unknown to genealogists.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_530" id="Foot_530" href="#Ref_530">[530]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
William de Sai had married Beatrice, sister (and, in her issue, heiress)
of the earl, by whom he was ancestor of the second line of Mandeville, Earl
of Essex. In the following year he joined the earl in his furious revolt
against the king.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_531" id="Foot_531" href="#Ref_531">[531]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This was William "Capra" (<i>Chévre</i>), whose family gave its name to
the manor of "Chevers" in Mountnessing, county Essex. He was probably
another brother-in-law of the earl, for I have seen a charter of Alice
(<i>Adelid[is]</i>) Capra, in which she speaks of Geoffrey's son, Earl William, as
her nephew ("nepos"). There is also a charter of a Geoffrey Capra and
Mazelina (<i>sic</i>) his wife, which suggests that the name of Geoffrey may have
come to the family from the earl. Thoby Priory, Essex, was founded (1141-1151)
by Michael Capra, Roesia his wife, and William, their son. The
founder speaks of Roger fitz Richard ("ex cujus munificentiâ mihi idem
fundus pervenit"), who was the second husband (as I have elsewhere
explained) of "Alice of Essex," <i>née</i> de Vere, the sister of Earl Geoffrey's
wife. A Michael Capra and a William Capra, holding respectively four and
four and a half knights' fees, were feudal tenants of Walter fitz Robert (the
lord of Dunmow) in 1166.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_532" id="Foot_532" href="#Ref_532">[532]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
William, son of Walter (Fitz Other) de Windsor, castellan of Windsor.
In the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I., he appears as in charge of Windsor
Forest, for which he renders his account. It is probably to this charter
rather than to any separate grant that Dugdale refers in his account of the
family.</p>

This is an unusual name. As William de Say is mentioned just
before, it may be noted that his son (Earl Geoffrey's nephew) promised (in
1150-1160) to grant to Ramsey Abbey "marcatam redditus ex quo adipisci
poterit quadraginta marcatas de hereditate sua, scilicet de terra Roberti
<i>de Rumele</i>" (<i>Chron. Ram.</i>, p. 305). Mathew de Romeli, according to
Dugdale, was the son of Robert de Romeli, lord of Skipton, by Cecily his
wife. A Mathew de Romeli, with Alan his son, occur in a plea of 1236-7
(<i>Bracton's Note-Book</i>, ed. Maitland, iii. 189).</p>

Robert de Courci of Stoke (Courcy), Somerset. He figures in the Pipe-Roll
of 31 Hen. I. As "Robert de Curci" he witnessed the Empress's
charter creating the earldom of Hereford (July 25, 1141), and as "Robert de
Curci Dapifer" her confirmation of the Earl of Devon's gift (<i>Mon. Aug.</i>, v.
106; <i>Journ. B. A. A.</i>, xxxi. 391), both of them passing at Oxford, the latter
(probably) in 1142, subsequent to the above charter. He was slain at
Counsylth, 1157.</p>

John Fitz Gilbert, marshal to the Empress, and brother, as the succeeding
charter proves, to William, her chancellor. With his father, Gilbert
the Marshal (<i>Mariscallus</i>), he was unsuccessfully impleaded, under Henry I.,
by Robert de Venoiz and William de Hastings, for the office of marshal
(<i>Rot. Cart.</i>, 1 John), and in 1130, as John the Marshal (<i>Mariscallus</i>), he
appears as charged, with his relief, in Wiltshire, for his father's lands and
office (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 31 Hen. I.). He is mentioned among the "barons" on the
side of the Empress at the siege of Winchester (<i>Gesta Stephani</i>), and he was,
with Robert de Curcy, witness to her (Oxford) charter, which I assign in the
last note to later in this year, as he also had been to her charter creating the
earldom of Hereford (July 25, 1141). Subsequently, he witnessed the charter
to the son of the Earl of Essex (<i>vide post</i>). He played some part in the next
reign from his official connection with the Becket quarrel. See also p. 131.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_542" id="Foot_542" href="#Ref_542">[542]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Miles de Beauchamp, son of Robert de Beauchamp, and nephew to
Simon de Beauchamp, hereditary castellan of Bedford. In 1130 he appears
in connection with Beds. and Bucks. (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 31 Hen. I.). With his
brother (<i>Salop Cartulary</i>) Payn de Beauchamp (who afterwards married
Rohaise, the widow of this Geoffrey de Mandeville), he had held Bedford
Castle against the king for five weeks from Christmas, 1137, as heir-male to
his uncle, whose daughter and heir, with the Bedford barony, Stephen had
conferred on Hugh <i>Pauper</i>, brother of his favourite, the Count of Meulan
(<i>Ord. Vit.</i>; <i>Gesta Steph.</i>). Dugdale's account is singularly inaccurate.
Simon, the uncle, must have been living in the spring of 1136, for he then
witnessed, as a royal <i>dapifer</i>, Stephen's great (Oxford) charter.</p>

Robert de Oilli the second, castellan of Oxford, and constable. Founder
of Osney Priory. He appears in the Pipe-Roll of 31 Hen. I., and had witnessed,
as a royal <i>constabularius</i>, Stephen's great (Oxford) charter of 1136,
but had embraced the cause of the Empress in 1141 (see p. 66). He witnessed
five others of the Empress's charters, all of which passed at Oxford
(<i>Journ. B. A. A.</i>, xxxi. 391, 392, 396, 397).</p>

"Johelus de Meduanâ" (Juhel of Mayenne) figures in the Pipe-Roll
of 31 Hen. I. as holding land in Devonshire. At the commencement of
Stephen's reign, Geoffrey of Anjou had entrusted him with three of the
castles he had captured in Normandy, on condition of receiving his support
(<i>R. of Torigni</i>).</p>

Clairvaux was a castle in Anjou. Payn de Clairvaux (<i>de Claris vallibus</i>)
had, in 1130, and for some time previously, been fermor of Hastings, in
Sussex (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 31 Hen. I. p. 42). Later on, in Stephen's reign, he
appears at Caen, witnessing a charter of Geoffrey, Duke of Normandy
(Bayeux <i>Liber Niger</i>).</p>

Peter de Valoines. The occurrence of this great Hertfordshire baron is
of special interest, because we have seen the Empress granting a charter to
his father, Roger, in 1141. It is probable, therefore, that Roger had died in the
interval. Peter himself died before 1166, when his younger brother, Robert,
had succeeded him. His widow, Gundred (de Warrenne), was then living.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_559" id="Foot_559" href="#Ref_559">[559]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This negotiation between the Empress and Geoffrey should be compared
with that between her and the legate in the spring of the preceding year.
Each illustrates the other. In the latter case the expression used is,
"Juravit et <i>affidavit</i> imperatrix episcopo quod," etc. In the former, the
empress is made to say, "Hanc autem convencionem et donacionem tenendam
<i>affidavi</i>," etc. But the striking point of resemblance is that in each case
her leading followers are made to take part in the pledge of performance.
At Winchester, we read in William of Malmesbury, "Idem juraverunt cum
ea, et affidaverunt pro eâ, Robertus frater ejus comes de Gloecestrâ, et
Brianus filius comitis marchio de Walingeford, et Milo de Gloecestriâ, postea
comes de Hereford, et nonnulli alii" (see p. 58). At Oxford, we read in
these charters, "Et hujus fiduciæ sunt obsides per fidem et Testes, Robertus
comes Gloecestrie, et Milo comes Herefordie, et Brianus filius comitis et," etc.
So close a parallel further confirms the genuineness of these charters.

Another remarkable document illustrative of this negotiation is the
alliance ("Confederatio amoris") between the Earls of Hereford and
Gloucester (see Appendix S). Each earl there "affidavit et juravit" to the
other, and each named certain of his followers as his "obsides per fidem"—the
very phrase here used. See also p. 385, <i>n.</i> 3.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_560" id="Foot_560" href="#Ref_560">[560]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That these securities were modelled on the practice of contracting
sovereign powers is seen on comparing them with the treaty between Henry I.
and the Count of Flanders (see Appendix S). But most to the point is the
treaty between King Stephen and Duke Henry, where the clause for
securing the "conventiones" runs:—"Archiepiscopi vero et episcopi ab
utraque parte in manu ceperunt quod si quis nostrum a predictis conventionibus
recederet, tam diu eum ecclesiastica justicia coercebunt, quousque errata
corrigat et ad predictam pactionem observandam redeat. Mater etiam
Ducis et ejus uxor et fratres ipsius Ducis et omnes sui quos ad hoc applicare
poterit, hæc assecurabunt."</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_561" id="Foot_561" href="#Ref_561">[561]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
We may perhaps compare the oath taken by the French king some
years before, to secure the charter ("Keure") granted to St. Omer by
William, Count of Flanders (April 14, 1127):—"Hanc igitur Communionem
tenendam, has supradictas consuetudines et conventiones esse observandas
fide promiserunt et sacramento confirmaverunt Ludovicus rex Francorum,
Guillelmus Comes Flandriæ," etc., etc.</p>

Ralph fitz Adam a quarter, Ralph de Guisnes one, Geoffrey Arsic two,
Robert de Cocefeld three, Ralph Carbonel one and a half. Hugh de Ging'
was the "Hugo de Inga" who acted as proxy (<i>vide supra</i>) at Henry's confirmation
of his mother's charter. This charter has an independent value
for its bearing on knights' fees. See also Addenda.</p>

last is of special value for its mention of her escape from the tower of the
castle. It states that Stephen "besæt hire in the tur," and that she was on
the night of her escape let down by ropes from the tower ("me læt hire dun
on niht of the tur mid rapes"). It is difficult to see how this can mean anything
else than that she was lowered to the ground from the existing tower,
instead of leaving by a gate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<small>FALL AND DEATH OF GEOFFREY.</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
movements of Geoffrey during the latter half of 1142
are shrouded in utter darkness. After the surrender of
the isle of Ely, we lose sight of him altogether, save in
the glimpse afforded us by the Oxford intrigue. It is,
however, quite possible that we should assign to the period
of the siege of Oxford Castle (September-December, 1142)
a charter to Abingdon Abbey which passed at Oxford.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_616" id="Ref_616" href="#Foot_616">[616]</a></span>
For if we deduct from its eight witnesses the two local
barons (Walter de Bocland and Hugh de Bolbec), five of
the remaining six are found in the Canterbury charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_617" id="Ref_617" href="#Foot_617">[617]</a></span>
In that case, Geoffrey, who figures at their head, must
have been at Oxford, in Stephen's quarters, at some time
in the course of the siege. He would obviously not declare
for the Empress till the time was ripe for the scheme,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
and, in the meanwhile, it might disarm suspicion, and
secure his safety in the case of the capture or defeat of
the Empress, if he continued outwardly in full allegiance
to the king.</p>

<p>It was not till the following year that the crisis at
length came. Stephen, at Mid-Lent, had attended a
council at London, at which decrees were passed against
the general disregard of the rights and privileges of the
Church. Her ministers were henceforth to be free from
outrage, and her sanctuaries from violation, under penalty
of an excommunication which only the pope himself could
remove.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_618" id="Ref_618" href="#Foot_618">[618]</a></span></p>

<p>At some period in the course of the year (1143) after
this council—possibly about the end of September—the
king held a court at St. Albans, to which, it would seem,
there came the leading nobles of the realm.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_619" id="Ref_619" href="#Foot_619">[619]</a></span> Among them
was the Earl of Essex, still at the height of his power.
Of what passed on this occasion we have, from independent
quarters, several brief accounts.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_620" id="Ref_620" href="#Foot_620">[620]</a></span> Of the main fact there
is no question. Stephen, acting on that sudden impulse
which roused him at times to unwonted vigour, struck at
last, and struck home. The mighty earl was seized and
bound, and according to the regular practice throughout
this internecine warfare, the surrender of the castles on
which his strength was based was made the price of his
liberty. As with the arrest of the bishops at Oxford in
1139, so was it now with the arrest of the great earl at St.
Albans, and so it was again to be at Northampton, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
the arrest of the Earl of Chester some three years later.
What it was that decided Stephen to seize this moment
for thus reasserting his authority, it is not so easy to
say. William of Newburgh, who is fullest on the subject,
gives us the story, which is found nowhere else, of the
earl's outrage on the king more than three years before,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_621" id="Ref_621" href="#Foot_621">[621]</a></span>
and tells us that Stephen had been ever since awaiting
an opportunity for revenge.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_622" id="Ref_622" href="#Foot_622">[622]</a></span> He adds that the height of
power to which the earl had attained had filled the king
with dread, and hints, I think, obscurely at that great
conspiracy of which the earl, as we have seen, was the
pivot and the moving spirit.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_623" id="Ref_623" href="#Foot_623">[623]</a></span> Henry of Huntingdon
plainly asserts that his seizure was a necessity for the
king, who would otherwise have lost his crown through
the King-maker's treacherous schemes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_624" id="Ref_624" href="#Foot_624">[624]</a></span> We may, indeed,
safely believe that the time had now come when Stephen
felt that it must be decided whether he or Geoffrey were
master.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_625" id="Ref_625" href="#Foot_625">[625]</a></span> But, as with the arrest of the bishops at Oxford
four years before, so, at this similar crisis, his own feelings
and his own jealousy of a power beneath which he chafed
were assiduously fostered and encouraged by a faction
among the nobles themselves. This is well brought out
in the Chronicle of Walden Abbey,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_626" id="Ref_626" href="#Foot_626">[626]</a></span> and still more so in
the <i>Gesta</i>. It is there distinctly asserted that this faction
worked upon the king, by reminding him of Geoffrey's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
unparalleled power, and of his intention to declare for
the Empress, urging him to arrest the earl as a traitor,
to seize his castles and crush his power, and so to secure
safety for himself and peace for his troubled realm.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_627" id="Ref_627" href="#Foot_627">[627]</a></span> It
is added that, Stephen hesitating to take the decisive step,
the jealousy of the barons blazed forth suddenly into open
strife, taunts and threats being hurled at one another by
the earl and his infuriated opponents.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_628" id="Ref_628" href="#Foot_628">[628]</a></span> On the king
endeavouring to allay the tumult, the earl was charged
to his face with plotting treason. Called upon to rebut
the charge, he did not attempt to do so, but laughed with
cynical scorn. The king, outraged beyond endurance, at
once ordered his arrest, and his foes rushed upon him.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_629" id="Ref_629" href="#Foot_629">[629]</a></span></p>

<p>The actual seizure of the earl appears to have been
attended by circumstances of which we are only informed
from a somewhat unexpected quarter. Mathew Paris,
from his connection with St. Albans, has been able to
preserve in his <i>Historia Anglorum</i> the local tradition of
the event. From this we learn, firstly, that there was a
struggle; secondly, that there was a flagrant violation of
the right of sanctuary. The struggle, indeed, was so
sharp that the Earl of Arundel, whom we know to have
been an old opponent of Geoffrey (see p. 323), was rolled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
over, horse and all, and nearly drowned in "Holywell."
The fact that this tussle took place in the open would
seem to imply that the whole of this highly dramatic
episode took place out of doors.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_630" id="Ref_630" href="#Foot_630">[630]</a></span> As to the other of these
two points, it is clear that there was something discreditable
to Stephen, according to the opinion of the time, in
his sudden seizure of the earl. William of Newburgh
observes that he acted "non quidem honeste et secundum
jus gentium, sed pro merito ejus et metu; scilicet, quod
expediret quam quod deceret plus attendens." Henry of
Huntingdon similarly writes that such a step was "magis
secundum retributionem nequitiæ consulis quam secundum
jus gentium, magis ex necessitate quam ex honestate."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_631" id="Ref_631" href="#Foot_631">[631]</a></span>
The Chronicle of Walden, also, complains of the circumstances
of his arrest;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_632" id="Ref_632" href="#Foot_632">[632]</a></span> and even the panegyrist of Stephen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
is anxious to clear his fame by imputing to the barons the
suggestion of what he admits to be a questionable act, and
claiming for the king the credit of reluctance to adopt
their advice.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_633" id="Ref_633" href="#Foot_633">[633]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was a more serious charge brought against
the king than that of dishonourable behaviour to the earl.
He was accused of violating by his conduct the rights of
sanctuary of St. Albans, though he had sworn, we are
told, not to do so, and had taken part so shortly before
in that council of London at which such violations were
denounced. The abbot's knights, indeed, went so far as
to resist by force of arms this outrage on the Church's
rights.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_634" id="Ref_634" href="#Foot_634">[634]</a></span> It is clearly to the contest thus caused, rather
than (as implied by Mathew) to the actual arrest of
Geoffrey, that we must assign the struggle in which the
Earl of Arundel was unhorsed by Walchelin de Oxeai, for
Walchelin was one of the abbey's knights, and was, therefore,
fighting in her cause.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_635" id="Ref_635" href="#Foot_635">[635]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the friends of the earl interceded on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
behalf,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_636" id="Ref_636" href="#Foot_636">[636]</a></span> the king had no alternative but to complete what
he had begun. After what he had done there could be no
hope of reconciliation with the earl. Geoffrey was offered
the usual choice; either he must surrender his castles, or
he must go to the gallows. Taken to London, he was
clearly made, according to the practice in these cases, to
order his own garrison to surrender to the king. Thus he
saw the fortress which he had himself done so much to
strengthen, the source of his power and of his pride, pass
for ever from his grasp. He had also to surrender, before
regaining his freedom, his ancestral Essex strongholds of
Pleshy and Saffron Walden.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_637" id="Ref_637" href="#Foot_637">[637]</a></span></p>

<p>The earl's impotent rage when he found himself thus
overreached is dwelt on by all the chroniclers.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_638" id="Ref_638" href="#Foot_638">[638]</a></span> The king's
move, moreover, had now forced his hand, and the revolt
so carefully planned could no longer be delayed, but broke
out prematurely at a time when the Empress was not in
a position to offer effective co-operation.</p>

<p>We must now return to the doings of Nigel, Bishop of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
Ely. That prelate had for a year (1142-43) been peacefully
occupied in his see. But at the council of 1143 his
past conduct had been gravely impugned. Alarmed at
the turn affairs were taking, he decided to consult the
Empress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_639" id="Ref_639" href="#Foot_639">[639]</a></span> He must, I think, have gone by sea, for we
find him, on his way at Wareham, the port for reaching
her in Wiltshire. Here he was surprised and plundered
by a party of the king's men.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_640" id="Ref_640" href="#Foot_640">[640]</a></span> He succeeded, however,
in reaching the Empress, and then returned to Ely. He
had now resolved to appeal to the pope in person, a
resolve quickened, it may be, by the fact that the legate,
who was one of his chief opponents, had gone thither in
November (1143). With great difficulty, and after long
debate, he prevailed on the monks to let him carry off,
from among the remaining treasures of the church, a large
amount of those precious objects without the assistance
of which, especially in a doubtful cause, it would have been
but lost labour to appeal to the heir of the Apostles. As
it was Pope Lucius before whom he successfully cleared
his character, and as Lucius was not elected till the March
of the following year (1144), I have placed his departure
for Rome subsequent to that of the legate. He may, of
course, have arrived there sooner and applied to Cœlestine
without success, but as that pontiff favoured the Empress,
this is not probable. Indeed, the wording of the narrative
is distinctly opposed to the idea.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_641" id="Ref_641" href="#Foot_641">[641]</a></span> In any case, my object
is to show that the period of his absence abroad harmonizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
well with the London Chronicle, which places
Geoffrey's revolt about the end of the year. For the
bishop had been gone some time when the earl obtained
possession of Ely.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_642" id="Ref_642" href="#Foot_642">[642]</a></span></p>

<p>Hugh Bigod, the Earl of Norfolk, whose allegiance
had ever sat lightly upon him, appears to have eventually
become his ally,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_643" id="Ref_643" href="#Foot_643">[643]</a></span> but for the time we hear only of his
brother-in-law, William de Say, as actively embracing his
cause.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_644" id="Ref_644" href="#Foot_644">[644]</a></span> He must, however, have relied on at least the
friendly neutrality of his relatives, the Clares and the
De Veres, in Cambridgeshire, Suffolk, and Essex, as well
as on the loyalty of his own vassals. It is possible, from
scattered sources, to trace his plan of action, and to reconstruct
the outline of what we may term the fenland
campaign.</p>

<p>Fordham, in Cambridgeshire, on the Suffolk border,
appears to have been his base of operations. Here supplies
could reach him from Suffolk and North Essex. He was
thence enabled to advance to Ely, the bishop being at this
time absent at Rome, and his forces being hard pressed
by those which Stephen had despatched against them.
The earl gladly accepted their appeal to himself for
assistance, and was placed by them in possession of the
isle, including its key, Aldreth Castle.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_645" id="Ref_645" href="#Foot_645">[645]</a></span> He soon made
a further advance, and, pushing on in the same direction,
burst upon Ramsey Abbey on a December<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_646" id="Ref_646" href="#Foot_646">[646]</a></span> morning at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
daybreak, seized the monks in their beds, drove them forth
clad as they were, and turned the abbey into a fortified
post.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_647" id="Ref_647" href="#Foot_647">[647]</a></span></p>

<p>He was probably led to this step by the confusion then
reigning among the brethren. A certain scheming monk,
Daniel by name, had induced the abbot to resign in his
favour. The resignation was indignantly repudiated by
the monks and the tenants of the abbey, but Stephen,
bribed by Daniel, had visited Ramsey in person, and
installed him by force as abbot only eighteen days before
the earl's attack.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_648" id="Ref_648" href="#Foot_648">[648]</a></span> It is, therefore, quite possible that, as
stated in the Walden Chronicle, Daniel may have been
privy to this gross outrage. In any case the earl's
conduct excited universal indignation.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_649" id="Ref_649" href="#Foot_649">[649]</a></span> He stabled his
horses in the cloisters; he plundered the church of its
most sacred treasures; he distributed its manors among
his lawless followers, and he then sent them forth to
ravage far and wide. In short, in the words of the pious
chronicler, he made of the church of God a very den of
thieves.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_650" id="Ref_650" href="#Foot_650">[650]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
But for the time these same enormities enabled the
daring earl at once to increase the number of his followers
and to acquire a strategical position unrivalled for his
purpose. The soldiers of fortune and mercenary troopers
who now swarmed throughout the land flocked in crowds
to his standard, and he was soon at the head of a sufficient
force to undertake offensive operations.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_651" id="Ref_651" href="#Foot_651">[651]</a></span> From his advanced
post at Ramsey Abbey, he was within striking
distance of several important points, while himself comparatively
safe from attack. His front and right flank
were covered by the meres and fens; his left was to some
extent protected by the Ouse and its tributaries, and was
further strengthened by a fortified work, erected by his son
Ernulf at one of the abbey's manors, Wood Walton.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_652" id="Ref_652" href="#Foot_652">[652]</a></span> In
his rear lay the isle of Ely, with its castles in the hands
of his men, and its communications with the Eastern
Counties secured by his garrison at Fordham.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_653" id="Ref_653" href="#Foot_653">[653]</a></span> His positions
at Ely and Ramsey were themselves connected by a
garrison, on the borders of the two counties, at Benwick.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_654" id="Ref_654" href="#Foot_654">[654]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
Thus situated, the earl was enabled to indulge his
thirst for vengeance, if not on Stephen himself, at least
on his unfortunate subjects. From his fastness in the

<p>Cambridge, as being the king's town, underwent at his
hands the same fate that Nottingham had suffered in
1140, or Worcester in 1139, at the hands of the Earl of
Gloucester.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_656" id="Ref_656" href="#Foot_656">[656]</a></span> Bursting suddenly on the town, he surprised,
seized, and sacked it. As at Worcester, the
townsmen had stored in the churches such property as
they could; but the earl was hardened to sacrilege: the
doors were soon crashing beneath the axes of his eager
troopers, and when they had pillaged to their hearts'
content, the town was committed to the flames.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_657" id="Ref_657" href="#Foot_657">[657]</a></span> The
whole country round was the scene of similar deeds.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_658" id="Ref_658" href="#Foot_658">[658]</a></span>
The humblest village church was not safe from his
attack,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_659" id="Ref_659" href="#Foot_659">[659]</a></span> but the religious houses, from their own wealth,
and from the accumulated treasures which, for safety,
were then stored within their walls, offered the most
alluring prize. It is only from the snatch of a popular
rhyme that we learn incidentally the fact that St. Ives
was treated even as the abbey of which it was a daughter-house.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
In a MS. of the <i>Historia Anglorum</i> there is preserved
by Mathew Paris the tradition that the earl and
his lawless followers mockingly sang of their wild doings—</p>

<p>Emboldened by success, he extended his ravages, till
his deeds could no longer be ignored.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_662" id="Ref_662" href="#Foot_662">[662]</a></span> Stephen, at
length fairly roused, marched in strength against him,
determined to suppress the revolt. But the earl, skilfully
avoiding an encounter in the open field, took refuge in
the depths of the fenland and baffled the efforts of the
king. Finding it useless to prolong the chase, Stephen
fell back on his usual policy of establishing fortified posts
to hem the rebels in. In these he placed garrisons, and
so departed.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>Geoffrey was now at his worst. Checked in extending
his sphere of plunder, he ravaged, with redoubled energy,
the isle itself. His tools, disguised as beggars, wandered
from door to door, to discover those who were still able
to relieve them from their scanty stores. The hapless
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
victims of this stratagem were seized at dead of night,
dragged before the earl as a great prize, and exposed in
turn to every torture that a devilish ingenuity could devise
till the ransom demanded by their captors had been
extorted to the uttermost farthing.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_664" id="Ref_664" href="#Foot_664">[664]</a></span> I cannot but think
that the terrible picture of the cruelties which have made
this period memorable for ever in our history was painted
by the Peterborough chronicler from life, and that these
very doings in his own neighbourhood inspired his imperishable
words.</p>

<p>Nor was it only the earl that the brethren of Ely had
to fear. Stephen, infuriated at the loss of the isle, laid
the blame at their bishop's door, and seized all those of
their possessions which were not within the earl's grasp.
The monks, thus placed "between the devil and the deep
sea," were indeed at their wits' end.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_665" id="Ref_665" href="#Foot_665">[665]</a></span> A very interesting
reference to this condition of things is found in a communication
from the pope to Archbishop Theobald, stating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
that Bishop Nigel of Ely has written to complain that
he found on his return from Rome that Earl Geoffrey, in
his absence, had seized and fortified the isle, and ravaged
the possessions of his church within it, while Stephen had
done the same for those which lay without it. As it
would seem that this document has not been printed, I
here append the passage:—</p>

<p class="small">"Venerabilis frater noster N. elyensis episcopus per literas suas
nobis significavit quod dum apostolicorum limina et nostram presentiam
visitasset, Gaufridus comes de mandeuilla elyensem insulam ubi
sedes episcopalis est violenter occupavit et quasdam sibi munitiones
in ea parauit. Occupatis autem ab ipso comite interioribus, Stephanus
rex omnes ejusdem ecclesie possessiones exteriores occupavit et
pro voluntate sua illicite distribuit."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_666" id="Ref_666" href="#Foot_666">[666]</a></span></p>

<p>This letter would seem to have been written subsequent
to Nigel's return. The bishop, however, had heard while
at Rome of these violent proceedings,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_667" id="Ref_667" href="#Foot_667">[667]</a></span> and had prevailed
on Lucius to write to Theobald and his fellow-bishops,
complaining—</p>

<p class="small">"Quod a quibusdam parrochianis vestris bona et possessiones
elyensis ecclesie, precipue dum ipse ab episcopatu expulsus esset,
direpta sunt et occupata et contra justitiam teneantur. Quidam
etiam sub nomine <i>tenseriarum</i> villas et homines suos spoliant et
injustis operationibus et exaccionibus opprimunt."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_668" id="Ref_668" href="#Foot_668">[668]</a></span></p>

<p>But the bishop was not the only sufferer who turned
to Rome for help. When Stephen installed the ambitious
Daniel as Abbot of Ramsey in person, Walter, the late
abbot, had sought "the threshold of the Apostles."
Daniel, whether implicated or not in Geoffrey's sacrilegious
deeds, found himself virtually deposed when the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
abbey became a fortress of the earl. Alarmed also for
the possible consequence of Walter's appeal to Rome, he
resolved to follow his example and betake himself to the
pope, trusting to the treasure that he was able to bring.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_669" id="Ref_669" href="#Foot_669">[669]</a></span>
The guileless simplicity of Walter, however, carried the
day; he found favour in the eyes of the curia and returned
to claim his abbey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_670" id="Ref_670" href="#Foot_670">[670]</a></span> But though he had been absent only
three months, the scene was changed indeed. That which
he had left "the House of God," he found, as we have
seen, "a den of thieves." But the "dove" who had
pleaded before the papal court could show himself, at need,
a lion. Filled, we are told, with the Holy Spirit, he
entered, undaunted, the earl's camp, seized a flaming
torch, and set fire not only to the tents of his troopers,
but also to the outer gate of the abbey, which they had
made the barbican of their stronghold. But neither this
novel adaptation of the orthodox "tongues of fire," nor
yet the more appropriate anathemas which he scattered
as freely as the flames, could convert the mailed sinners
from the error of their unhallowed ways. Indeed, it was
almost a miracle that he escaped actual violence, for the
enraged soldiery threatened him with death and brandished
their weapons in his face.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_671" id="Ref_671" href="#Foot_671">[671]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
In the excited state of the minds of those by whom
such sights were witnessed, portents would be looked for,
and found, as signs of the wrath of Heaven. Before long
it was noised abroad that the very walls of the abbey were
sweating blood, as a mark of Divine reprobation on the
deeds of its impious garrison.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_672" id="Ref_672" href="#Foot_672">[672]</a></span> Far and wide the story
spread; and men told with bated breath how they had
themselves seen and touched the abbey's bleeding walls.
Among those attracted by the wondrous sight was Henry,
Archdeacon of Huntingdon, who has recorded for all time
that he beheld it with his own eyes.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_673" id="Ref_673" href="#Foot_673">[673]</a></span> And as they spoke
to one another of the miracle, in which they saw the finger
of God, the starving peasants whispered their hopes that
the hour of their deliverance was at hand.</p>

<p>The time, indeed, had come. As the now homeless
abbot wandered over the abbey's lands, sick at heart, in
weariness and want, the sights that met his despairing
eyes were enough to make him long for death.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_674" id="Ref_674" href="#Foot_674">[674]</a></span> Barely
a plough remained on all his broad demesnes; all provisions
had been carried off; no man tilled the land.
Every lord had now his castle, and every castle was a
robber's nest.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_675" id="Ref_675" href="#Foot_675">[675]</a></span> In vain he boldly appealed to Earl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
Geoffrey himself, warning him to his face that he and his
would remain cut off from the communion of Christians
till the abbey was restored to its owners. The earl listened
with impatience, and gave him a vague promise; but he
kept his hold of the abbey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_676" id="Ref_676" href="#Foot_676">[676]</a></span> The heart of the spoiler was
hardened like that of Pharaoh of old, and not even
miracles could move him to part with his precious
stronghold.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_677" id="Ref_677" href="#Foot_677">[677]</a></span></p>

<p>But if Ramsey had thus suffered, what had been the
fate of Ely? A bad harvest, combined with months of
systematic plunder, had brought about a famine in the
land. For the space of twenty or even thirty miles,
neither ox nor plough was to be seen; barely could the
smallest bushel of grain he bought for two hundred pence.
The people, by hundreds and thousands, were perishing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
for want of bread, and their corpses lay unburied in the
fields, a prey to beasts and to fowls of the air. Not for
ages past, as it seemed to the monks, had there been such
tribulation upon earth.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_678" id="Ref_678" href="#Foot_678">[678]</a></span> Nor were the peasants the only
sufferers. Might was then right, for all classes, throughout
the land;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_679" id="Ref_679" href="#Foot_679">[679]</a></span> the smaller gentry were themselves seized, and
held, by their captors, to ransom. As they heard of
distant villages in flames, as they gazed on strings of
captives dragged from their ravaged homes, the words of
the psalmist were adapted in the mouths of the terrified
monks: "They bind the godly with chains, and the nobles
with links of iron."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_680" id="Ref_680" href="#Foot_680">[680]</a></span> In the mad orgie of wickedness
neither women nor the aged were spared. Ransom was
wrung from the quivering victims by a thousand refinements
of torture. In the groans of the sufferers, in the
shrieks of the tortured, men beheld the fulfilment of the
words of St. John the Apostle, "In those days shall men
... desire to die, and death shall flee from them."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_681" id="Ref_681" href="#Foot_681">[681]</a></span></p>

<p>Again we are tempted to ask if we have not in these
very scenes the actual original from which was drawn the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
picture in the English Chronicle, a picture which might
thus be literally true of the chronicler's own district,
while not necessarily applicable, as the latest research
suggests, to the whole of Stephen's realm.</p>

<p>It was now that men "said openly that Christ slept,
and His saints." The English chronicler seems to imply,
and Henry of Huntingdon distinctly asserts, that the
wicked, emboldened by impunity, said so in scornful
derision; but William of Newburgh assigns the cry to
the sufferings of a despairing people. It is probable
enough that both were right, that the people and their
oppressors had reversed the parts of Elijah and the
priests of Baal. For a time there seemed to rise in vain
the cry so quaintly Englished in the paraphrase of John
Hopkins:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote1">"Why doost withdraw thy hand aback,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And hide it in thy lappe?</div>
<div class="verse">O pluck it out, and be not slack</div>
<div class="verse indent2">To give thy foes a rappe!"</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="nodent">But when night is darkest, dawn is nearest,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_682" id="Ref_682" href="#Foot_682">[682]</a></span> and the end
of the oppressor was at hand. It was told in after days
how even Nature herself had shown, by a visible sign,
her horror of his impious deeds. While marching to the
siege of Burwell on a hot summer's day, he halted at the
edge of a wood, and lay down for rest in the shade.
And lo! the very grass withered away beneath the touch
of his unhallowed form!<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_683" id="Ref_683" href="#Foot_683">[683]</a></span></p>

<p>The fortified post which the king's men had now established
at Burwell was a standing threat to Fordham, the
key of his line of communications. He was therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
compelled to attack it. And there he was destined to die
the death of Richard Cœur de Lion. As he reconnoitred
the position to select his point of attack, or as, according
to others, he was fighting at the head of the troops, he
carelessly removed his headpiece and loosened his coat
of mail. A humble bowman saw his chance: an arrow
whizzed from the fortress, and struck the unguarded head.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_684" id="Ref_684" href="#Foot_684">[684]</a></span></p>

<p>There is a conflict of testimony as to the date of the
event. Henry of Huntingdon places it in August, while
M. Paris (<i>Chron. Maj.</i>, ii. 177) makes him die on the 14th
of September, and the Walden Chronicle on the 16th.
Possibly he was wounded in August and lingered on into
September, but, in any case, Henry's date is the most
trustworthy.</p>

<p>The monks of Ramsey gloried in the fact that their
oppressor had received his fatal wound as he stood on
ground which their abbey owned, as a manifest proof that
his fate was incurred by the wrong he had done to their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
patron saint.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_685" id="Ref_685" href="#Foot_685">[685]</a></span> At Waltham Abbey, with equal pride, it
was recorded that he who had refused to atone for the
wrong he had done to its holy cross received his wound
in the self-same hour in which its aid was invoked against
the oppressor of its shrine.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_686" id="Ref_686" href="#Foot_686">[686]</a></span> But all were agreed that
such a death was a direct answer to the prayer of the
oppressed, a signal act of Divine vengeance on one who
had sinned against God and man.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_687" id="Ref_687" href="#Foot_687">[687]</a></span></p>

<p>For the wound was fatal. The earl, like Richard in
after days, made light of it at first.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_688" id="Ref_688" href="#Foot_688">[688]</a></span> Retiring, it would
seem, through Fordham, along the Thetford road, he
reached Mildenhall in Suffolk, and there he remained, to
die. The monks of his own foundation believed, and perhaps
with truth, that when face to face with death, he
displayed heartfelt penitence, prayed earnestly that his
sins might he forgiven, and made such atonement to God
and man as his last moments could afford. But there
was none to give him the absolution he craved; indeed,
after the action which the Church had taken the year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
before, it is doubtful if any one but the pope could absolve
so great a sinner.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_689" id="Ref_689" href="#Foot_689">[689]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean time the Abbot of Ramsey heard the startling
news, and saw that his chance had come. The earl
might be willing to save his soul at the cost of restoring
the abbey. To Mildenhall he flew in all haste, but only
to find that the earl had already lost consciousness. There
awaited him, however, the fruit of his oppressor's tardy
repentance in the form of instructions from the earl to
his son to surrender Ramsey Abbey. Armed with these,
the abbot departed as speedily as he had come.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_690" id="Ref_690" href="#Foot_690">[690]</a></span></p>

<p>The tragic end of the great earl must have filled the
thoughts of men with a strange awe and horror. That
one who had rivalled, but a year ago, the king himself in
power, should meet an inglorious death at the hands of a
wretched churl, that he who had defied the thunders of the
Church should fall as if by a bolt from heaven, were facts
which, in the highly wrought state of the minds of men at
the time, were indeed signs and wonders.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_691" id="Ref_691" href="#Foot_691">[691]</a></span> But even more
tragic than his death was the fate which awaited his
corpse. Unshriven, he had passed away laden with the
curses of the Church. His soul was lost for ever; and his
body no man might bury.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_692" id="Ref_692" href="#Foot_692">[692]</a></span> As the earl was drawing his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
last breath there came upon the scene some Knights
Templar, who flung over him the garb of their order so
that he might at least die with the red cross upon his
breast.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_693" id="Ref_693" href="#Foot_693">[693]</a></span> Then, proud in the privileges of their order, they
carried the remains to London, to their "Old Temple" in
Holborn. There the earl's corpse was enclosed in a leaden
coffin, which was hung, say some, on a gnarled fruit tree,
that it might not contaminate the earth, or was hurled,
according to others, into a pit without the churchyard.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_694" id="Ref_694" href="#Foot_694">[694]</a></span>
So it remained, for nearly twenty years, exposed to the
gibes of the Londoners, the earl's "deadly foes." But
with the characteristic faithfulness of a monastic house
to its founder, the monks of Walden clung to the hope
that the ban of the Church might yet be removed, and the
bones of the great earl be suffered to rest among them.
According to their chronicle, Prior William, who had
obtained his post from Geoffrey's hands, rested not till
he had wrung his absolution from Pope Alexander III.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_695" id="Ref_695" href="#Foot_695">[695]</a></span>
(1159-1181). But the <i>Ramsey Chronicle</i>, which appears
to be a virtually contemporary record, assigns the eventual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
removal of the ban to Geoffrey's son and namesake, and
to the atonement which he made to Ramsey Abbey on his
father's behalf.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_696" id="Ref_696" href="#Foot_696">[696]</a></span> The latter story is most precise, but
both may well be true. For, although the Ramsey
chronicler would more especially insist on the fact that
St. Benedict had to be appeased before the earl could be
absolved, the absolution itself would be given not by the
abbot, but by the pope. The grant to Ramsey would be
merely a condition of the absolution itself being granted.
The nature of the grant is known to us not only from the
chronicle, but also from the primate's charter confirming
this final settlement.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_697" id="Ref_697" href="#Foot_697">[697]</a></span> As this confirmation is dated at
Windsor, April 6, 1163, we thus, roughly, obtain the date
of the earl's Christian burial.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_698" id="Ref_698" href="#Foot_698">[698]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
The Prior of Walden had gained his end, and he now
hastened to the Temple to claim his patron's remains.
But his hopes were cruelly frustrated at the very moment
of success. Just as the body of the then earl (1163) was
destined to be coveted at his death (1166) by two rival
houses, so now the remains of his father were a prize
which the indignant Templars would never thus surrender.
Warned of the prior's coming, they instantly seized the
coffin, and buried it at once in their new graveyard, where,
around the nameless resting-place of the great champion
of anarchy, there was destined to rise, in later days, the
home of English law.<span class="fnanchor"><a

See p. 143. They are Earl Geoffrey, Robert de Ver, William of Ypres,
Adam "de Belnaio," and Richard de Luci. The sixth, "Mainfeninus
Brito," we have seen attesting Stephen's first charter to Geoffrey in 1140
(p. 52). Another charter, perhaps, may also be assigned to this period,
namely, that of Stephen (at Oxford) to St. Frideswide's, of which the original
is now preserved in the Bodleian Library. For this, as for the preceding
charter, the date suggested is 1135 (<i>Calendar of Charters and Rolls</i>), but the
names of William of Ypres and Richard de Luci prove that this date is too
early. These names, with that of Robert de Ver, are common to both
charters, and if Richard de Luci's earliest attestation is in the summer of
1140, it is quite possible that this charter should be assigned to the siege
of 1142.</p>

This story, being told by Mathew Paris alone, and evidently as a
matter of tradition, must be accepted with considerable caution. He makes
the singular and careless mistake of speaking of Earl Geoffrey as William
(<i>sic</i>) de Mandeville, though he properly terms him, the following year,
"Gaufridus consul de Mandeville." On the other hand, it is possible to
apply a test which yields not unsatisfactory results. Mathew tells us that
the Earl of Arundel was unhorsed "a Walkelino de Oxeai [<i>alias</i> Oxehaie]
milite strenuissimo." Now there was, contemporary with Mathew himself,
a certain Richard "de Oxeya," who held by knight-service of St. Albans
Abbey, and who, in 1245, was jointly responsible with "Petronilla de
Crokesle" for the service of one knight (<i>Chron. Majora</i>, vi. 437). Turning
to a list of the abbey's knights, which is dated by the editor in the Rolls
Series as "1258," but which is quite certainly some hundred years earlier,
we find this same knight's fee held jointly by Richard "de Crokesle" and a
certain "Walchelinus." Here then we may perhaps recognize that very
"Walchelinus de Oxeai" who figures in Mathew's story, a story which
Richard "de Oxeya" may have told him as a family tradition. Indeed,
there is evidence to prove that this identification is correct.</p>

and on p. 48 after it, in his instructive remarks on the indebtedness of
William of Newburgh to others (p. xxvi.).</p>

An incidental allusion to this conflict between the followers of the king
and the abbey's knights is to be found, I think, in a curious passage in the
<i>Gesta Abbatum S. Albani</i> (i. 94). We there read of Abbot Geoffrey (1119-1146):
"Tabulam quoque unam ex auro et argento et gemmis electis
artificiose constructam ad longitudinem et latitudinem altaris Sancti Albani,
quam deinde, ingruente maxima necessitate, idem Abbas in igne conflavit et
in massam confregit. Quam dedit Comiti de Warrena et Willelmo de Ypra
et Comiti de Arundel et Willelmo Martel, temporibus Regis Stephani, <i>Villam
Sancti Albani volentibus concremare</i>." The conjunction of William of Ypres
with Abbot Geoffrey dates this incident within the limits 1139-1146, and
there is no episode to which it can be so fitly assigned as this of 1143,
especially as the Earl of Arundel figures in both versions.</p>

"Rex igitur Galfridum, custodiis arctissime adhibitis, Londonias

consilio, ut imminens inhonestæ mortis periculum, castellis redditis, devitaret,

eum reddidit ei turrim Lundoniæ et castellum de Waledene et illud de
Plaisseiz" (<i>Hen. Hunt.</i>, p. 276). "Eique arcem Lundoniensem cum duobus
reliquis quæ possidebat castellis extorsit [rex]" (<i>W. Newburgh</i>, i. 45). The
castle of (Saffron) Walden, with the surrounding district, was placed by
Stephen in charge of Turgis d'Avranches, whom we have met with before,
and who refused, some two years later, to admit the king to it (<i>Gesta</i>, ed.
Howlett, p. 101). Mr. Howlett appears to have confused it with another
castle which Stephen took "in the Lent of 1139," for Walden was Geoffrey's
hereditary seat and had always been in his hands.</p>

is applied to the state of things which awaited the abbot on Earl Geoffrey's
death, is obviously in point here. It is of importance for its allusion to the
plough, which illustrates the language of Domesday (the plough-teams being
always the first to suffer, and the most serious loss: compare Bishop Denewulf's
tenth-century charter in <i>Liber de Hyda</i>), but still more for its mention
of the <i>tenseriæ</i>. Here we have the very same word, used at the very same
time, at Peterborough, Ramsey, and Ely. The correction, therefore, of the
English Chronicle is utterly unjustifiable (see Appendix AA). Moreover, a comparison
of this passage with the letter of Pope Lucius (<i>ante</i>, p. 215) shows that
at Ramsey, as at Ely, the evil effect of this state of things continued in these
<i>tenseriæ</i> even after the bishop and the abbot had respectively regained possession.</p>

<i>Chron. Ram.</i>, pp. 306, 333. The king was probably at Windsor at the
time, and the date is a useful one for Becket's movements.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_698" id="Foot_698" href="#Ref_698">[698]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
A curious archæological question is raised by this date. According
to the received belief, the Templars did not remove to the New Temple till
1185, but, according to this evidence, they already had their churchyard there
consecrated in 1163, and had therefore, we may presume, begun their church.
The church of the New Temple was consecrated by Heraclius on his visit in
1185, but may have been finished sooner.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_699" id="Foot_699" href="#Ref_699">[699]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Cumque Prior ille corpus defunctum deponere et secum Waldenam
deferre satageret, Templarii illi caute premeditati statim illud tollentes, et in
cimiterio novi templi ignobili satis tradiderunt sepulturæ" (<i>Mon. Ang.</i>, iv.
142). It was generally believed that his effigy was among those remaining
at the Temple, but this supposition is erroneous, as has been shown by Mr.
J. G. Nichols in an elaborate article on "The Effigy attributed to Geoffrey
de Magnaville, and the Other Effigies in the Temple Church" (<i>Herald and
Genealogist</i> (1866), iii. 97, <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<small>THE EARLDOM OF ESSEX.</small></h2>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
death of Geoffrey was a fatal blow to the power of
the fenland rebels. According, indeed, to one authority,
his brother-in-law, William de Say, met his death on the
same occasion,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_700" id="Ref_700" href="#Foot_700">[700]</a></span> but it was the decease of the great earl
which filled the king's supporters with exultant joy and
hope.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_701" id="Ref_701" href="#Foot_701">[701]</a></span> For a time Ernulf, his son and heir, clung to the
abbey fortress, but at length, sorely against his will, he
gave up possession to the monks.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_702" id="Ref_702" href="#Foot_702">[702]</a></span> Before the year was
out, he was himself made prisoner and straightway
banished from the realm.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_703" id="Ref_703" href="#Foot_703">[703]</a></span> Nor was the vengeance of
Heaven even yet complete. The chief officer of the
wicked earl was thrown from his horse and killed,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_704" id="Ref_704" href="#Foot_704">[704]</a></span> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
the captain of his foot, who had made himself conspicuous
in the violating and burning of churches, met, as he fled
beyond the sea, with the fate of Jonah, and worse.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_705" id="Ref_705" href="#Foot_705">[705]</a></span></p>

<p>Chroniclers and genealogists have found it easiest
to ignore the subsequent fate of Ernulf (or Ernald) de
Mandeville.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_706" id="Ref_706" href="#Foot_706">[706]</a></span> He has even been conveniently disposed
of by the statement that he died childless.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_707" id="Ref_707" href="#Foot_707">[707]</a></span> It may therefore
fairly be described as a genealogical surprise to
establish the fact, beyond a shadow of doubt, not only
that he left issue, but that his descendants flourished for
generations, heirs in the direct male line of this once
mighty house. Ernulf himself first reappears, early in
the following reign, as a witness to a royal charter confirming
Ernald <i>de Bosco's</i> foundation at Betlesdene.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_708" id="Ref_708" href="#Foot_708">[708]</a></span>
He also occurs as a principal witness in a family
charter, about the same time.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_709" id="Ref_709" href="#Foot_709">[709]</a></span> This document,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_710" id="Ref_710" href="#Foot_710">[710]</a></span> which
is addressed by Earl Geoffrey "baronibus suis," is a
confirmation of a grant of lands in Sawbridgeworth, by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
his tenant Warine fitz Gerold "Camerarius Regis" and
his brother Henry, to Robert Blund of London, who is
to hold them "de predictis baronibus meis." The
witnesses are: "Roesia Com[itissa] matre mea, Eust[achia]
Com[itissa], Ernulfo de Mannavilla fratre meo,
Willelmo filio Otuwel patruo meo, Mauricio vicecomite,
Willelmo de Moch' capellano meo, Otuwel de bouile,
Ricardo filio Osberti, Radulfo de Bernires, Willelmo et
Ranulfo fil' Ernaldi, Gaufrido de Gerp[en]villa, Hugone
de Augo, Waltero de Mannavilla, Willelmo filio Alfredi,
Gaufredo filio Walteri, Willelmo de Plaisiz, Gaufrido
pincerna." He is, doubtless, also the "Ernald de Mandevill"
who holds a knight's fee, in Yorkshire, of Ranulf
fitz Walter in 1166.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_711" id="Ref_711" href="#Foot_711">[711]</a></span> But in the earliest Pipe-Rolls of
Henry II. he is already found as a grantee of <i>terræ datæ</i>
in Wilts., to the amount of £11 10<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i> (blanch) "in
Wurda." This grant was not among those repudiated
by Henry II., and Geoffrey de Mandeville, Ernulf's heir,
was still in receipt of the same sum in 1189<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_712" id="Ref_712" href="#Foot_712">[712]</a></span> and 1201-2.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_713" id="Ref_713" href="#Foot_713">[713]</a></span>
Later on, in a list of knights' fees in Wilts., which
must belong, from the mention of Earl William de
Longespée, to 1196-1226, and is probably <i>circ.</i> 1212, we
read: "Galfridus de Mandevill tenet in Wurth duas partes
unius militis de Rege."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_714" id="Ref_714" href="#Foot_714">[714]</a></span> That Ernulf should have received
a grant in Wilts., a county with which his family was not
connected, is probably accounted for by the fact that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
obtained it in the time of the Empress, who, as in the case
of Humfrey de Bohun, found the revenues of Wilts. convenient
as a means of rewarding her partisans.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_715" id="Ref_715" href="#Foot_715">[715]</a></span> But
we now come to a series of charters of the highest importance
for this discovery. These were preserved among the
muniments of Henry Beaufoe of Edmondescote, county
Warwick, Esq., when they were seen by Dugdale, who
does not, however, in his <i>Baronage</i>, allude to their
evidence. By the first of these Earl Geoffrey (died 1166)
grants to his brother Ernulf one knight's fee in Kingham,
county Oxon.:—</p>

<p>Ralph "de Nuers," is entered in 1166 as a former holder
of four fees from Earl Geoffrey (II.).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_717" id="Ref_717" href="#Foot_717">[717]</a></span> Of the witnesses
to the charter,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_718" id="Ref_718" href="#Foot_718">[718]</a></span> Henry fitz Gerold (probably the chamberlain)
held four fees (<i>de novo</i>) of the earl in 1166, Ralph
de Berners four (<i>de veteri</i>), Walter de Mandeville four
(<i>de veteri</i>), Geoffrey de Jarpe[n]ville one (<i>de novo</i>), Hugh de
Ou and William fitz Alfred one each (<i>de novo</i>), "Audoenus
Pincerna" and Ralph his brother the fifth of a fee (<i>de
novo</i>) jointly. The relative precedence, according to holding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
is not unworthy of notice. The second charter is
from Earl William, confirming his brother's gift:—</p>

<p class="small">"Willelmus de Mandavilla comes Essexie Omnibus hominibus,
etc. Sciatis me concessisse Ernulfo de Mandauilla fratri meo donationem

<p>Here Earl "Alberic" was uncle both to the grantor and
the grantee; Simon de Beauchamp was their uterine
brother; Geoffrey de Say their first cousin. William de
Boville would be related to Otuel de Boville, the chief
tenant of Mandeville in 1166.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_720" id="Ref_720" href="#Foot_720">[720]</a></span> "Sewalus de Osevill"
then (1166) held four fees (<i>de veteri</i>) of the earl. Richard
"de Rochellâ" held three-quarters of a fee (<i>de novo</i>).
Osbert fitz Richard was probably a son of Richard fitz
Osbert, who held four fees (<i>de veteri</i>) in 1166. Wiscard
Ledet was a tenant <i>in capite</i> in Oxfordshire (<i>Testa</i>, p. 103).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_721" id="Ref_721" href="#Foot_721">[721]</a></span></p>

<p>The third charter transfers the fee from the grantee
himself to his son:—</p>

<p class="small">"Notum sit ... quod ego Arnulfus de Mandeuilla concessi et dedi
Radulfo de Mandeuilla filio meo pro suo servicio et homagio villam de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>

name="Ref_723" id="Ref_723" href="#Foot_723">[723]</a></span></p>

<p>From another quarter we are enabled to continue the
chain of evidence. We have first a charter to Osney:—</p>

<p class="small">"Ego Gaufridus de Mandeuile ... confirmavi mercatam terre
quam Aaliz mater mea eis diuisit in Hugato, sic[?ut] Ernulfus de
Mandeuile pater meus eis assignavit."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_724" id="Ref_724" href="#Foot_724">[724]</a></span></p>

<p>Then we have a charter which thus carries us a step
further:—</p>

<p class="small">"Ego Galfridus de Mandeuilla filius Galfridi de Mandeuillâ concessi
Domino Galfrido patri meo, filio Arnulfi de Mandeuillâ," etc., etc.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_725" id="Ref_725" href="#Foot_725">[725]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the witnesses to this last charter are Robert
de Mandeville, and Ralph his brother, and Hugh de
Mandeville. Lastly, we have a charter of Ralph de Mandeville,
to which the first witness is "Galfridus de Mandauilla
frater meus."<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>A further charter (<i>Harl. Cart.</i>, 54, I. 44) can now be

Port, to the Bishop of Lincoln, etc., of his grant of the
church of "Hattele." The witnesses are: "Hernaldo de

<p>The importance of the existence of Ernulf and his
heirs is seen when we come to deal with the fate of the
earldom of Essex. That Ernulf was "exiled" even for
a time becomes a remarkable fact, when we remember that
he might have found shelter from the king among the
followers of the Empress in the west. But he and his
father had offended a power greater than the king. The
Empress could not shield him from the vengeance of
the outraged Church. It is, I think, in his doings at
Ramsey, and in the penalties he had thus incurred, that
we must seek the reason of his being, as we shall find,
so strangely passed over, in favour of his younger brother
Geoffrey, who had not partaken of his guilt.</p>

<p>To another charter, hitherto unknown, we owe our
knowledge of the fact that Geoffrey was recognized as his
father's heir, by the Empress, on his death. Instructive
as its contents would doubtless be, it is known to us only
from the following note, made by one who had inspected
its transcript in the lost volume of the Great Coucher:—</p>

<p class="small">"Carta M. Imperatricis per quam dat Gaufredo de Mannevill filio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>

name="Ref_730" id="Ref_730" href="#Foot_730">[730]</a></span></p>

<p>The names of Robert, Earl of Gloucester, and Roger,
Earl of Hereford, limit the date of this charter to 1144-1147,
and the father of the grantee died, as we have seen,
in August, 1144. It should be noted that nothing is said
here of the earldom of Essex, and that only an absolutely
new creation could confer the dignity on Geoffrey,
as he was not his father's heir.</p>

<p>Here, however, yet another charter, also at present
unknown, comes to our assistance with its unique evidence
that Geoffrey must have held his father's title before 1147.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_731" id="Ref_731" href="#Foot_731">[731]</a></span>
He then disappears from view for the time.</p>

<p>We must now skip some twelve years, and pass to that
most important charter in which the earldom was conferred
anew on Geoffrey by Henry II. Only those who
have made a special study of these subjects can realize
the value of this charter, a record hitherto unknown. The
attitude of Henry II. to the creations of Stephen and
Matilda, the extent to which he recognized them, and the
method in which he did so, are subjects on which the
historian is peculiarly anxious for information, but on
which our existing evidence is singularly and lamentably
slight. Of the four charters quoted in the <i>Reports on the
Dignity of a Peer</i>, only two can be said to have a real
bearing on the question, and of these one is of uncertain
date, while the meaning of the other is doubtful. But the
charter I am about to deal with is remarkably clear in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
its meaning, and possesses the advantage that its contents
enable us to date it with precision.</p>

<p>The original charter was formerly preserved in the
Cottonian collection, but was doubtless among those which
perished in the disastrous fire.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_732" id="Ref_732" href="#Foot_732">[732]</a></span> The copy of it made by
Dugdale, and now among his MSS. at Oxford, is unfortunately
imperfect, but the discovery of an independent copy
among the Rawlinson MSS. has enabled me not only to
fill the gaps in Dugdale's copy (which I have here placed
within brackets), but also to establish by collation the
accuracy of the text.</p>

The first point to be considered is that of the date. It
is obvious at once from the names of the primate and the
chancellor that the charter must be previous to the king's
departure from England in 1158. But the only occasion
within this limit on which the charter can have passed is
that of the king's visit to Canterbury on his way to Dover
and the Continent in January, 1156 (115⅚). On no other
occasion within this limit did he land at or depart from
Dover. Now, it is quite certain that the charter to Earl
Aubrey (de Vere), which is tested "Apud Dover in transitu
Regis," passed at the time of this departure from Dover
(January 10, 1156).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_735" id="Ref_735" href="#Foot_735">[735]</a></span> We find, then, that as in 1142 the
charters to Earl Geoffrey and Earl Aubrey were part of
one transaction and passed on the same occasion, so now,
the charters to Earl Geoffrey the second and Earl Aubrey,
his uncle, passed almost on the same day. The long list
of witnesses to the former, for which we are indebted to
the Rawlinson MS., enables us to compare it closely with
those of the four other charters which passed, according
to Mr. Eyton, about the same time.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_736" id="Ref_736" href="#Foot_736">[736]</a></span> The proportions of
their witnesses found among the witnesses to this charter
are respectively: seven out of ten in the first; nine out
of eighteen in the second; the whole ten in the third; and
seven out of fourteen in the fourth. As the king had
spent his Christmas at Westminster, we can thus fix the
date almost to a day, viz. <i>circ.</i> January 2, 1156. And
this harmonizes well enough with the evidence of the
Pipe-Rolls, which show that Earl Geoffrey was in receipt
of the <i>tertius denarius</i> in 1157, as from Michaelmas, 1155.</p>

<p>On looking at the terms of this instrument, we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
struck at once by the fact that it is a charter of actual
creation. This is in perfect accordance with the view
advanced above, namely, that the charter granted at
Devizes to this Geoffrey, as his father's son, has no bearing
on the earldom of Essex, "and that only an absolutely
new creation could confer the earldom on Geoffrey,
as he was not his father's heir." It is thus that the existence
of his brother Ernulf became a factor in the problem
of no small consequence.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_737" id="Ref_737" href="#Foot_737">[737]</a></span></p>

<p>Being thus an undoubted new creation, its terms
should be examined most carefully. It will then be found
that the precedent they follow is not the charter of the
Empress (1141), but the original charter of the king
(1140).</p>

<p class="nodent">The explanation is, of course, that the first and third

the only instance in point—</p>

<p class="nodent">Here the absolute identity of the actual formula of creation
accentuates the difference between the clauses relating to
the "Tertius Denarius." It will therefore be desirable
to compare the clauses as they stand in the Mandeville
and the Vere charters (January, 1156):—</p>

</table>

<p class="nodent">It is said with truth in the Lords' Reports that "inde"
is an ambiguous word, as it might refer either to the
county or to the "third penny" itself. And, indeed, the
above extract from the charter to Hugh Bigod would lend
support to the latter view. But the case of Earl Aubrey
was, we must remember, peculiar. As we saw in the
charter of the empress (1142), she recognized him as
already a "comes" in virtue of his rank as Count of
Guisnes (p. 188). It is my belief that in the present
charter he is styled "comes" by Henry on precisely the
same ground. For if Henry had recognized him as Earl
of Oxford in virtue of his mother's charter (1142), he must
also have recognized his right to "the third penny" of
the shire which was granted by that same charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_738" id="Ref_738" href="#Foot_738">[738]</a></span> But
he clearly did not recognize that right, for he here makes
a fresh grant. Therefore he did not recognize the validity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
of his mother's charter. Consequently, he styled Aubrey
"comes" in virtue only of the comital rank he enjoyed
as Count of Guisnes. And as he could not <i>make</i> a
"comes" of a man who was a "comes" already (p. 187),
he merely grants him "the third penny of the pleas" of
Oxfordshire, "that he may be earl of that county" ("ut
sit inde Comes"). Hence the anomalous form in which
the charter is drawn.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_739" id="Ref_739" href="#Foot_739">[739]</a></span></p>

<p>Different, again, yet no less instructive, is the case of
the Earl of Sussex. There the grant runs—</p>

<p class="small">"Sciatis me dedisse Willelmo Comiti Arundel castellum de Arundel
cum toto honore Arundel ... et tercium denarium de placitis de
Suthsex unde comes est."</p>

<p>This charter has been looked upon as relating to the
earldom itself, whereas it is clearly nothing but a grant
of the castle and honour of Arundel and of the "Tertius
Denarius" of Sussex, "of which county he is earl."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_740" id="Ref_740" href="#Foot_740">[740]</a></span>
When these two phrases are compared—"ut sit inde
Comes" and "unde Comes est"—their meaning is, surely,
clear. William was <i>already</i> Earl of Sussex (<i>alias</i> Arundel
<i>alias</i> Chichester), but his right to the "Tertius Denarius"
of the county was not recognized by the king. The fact
that this right required to be granted <i>nominatim</i> confirms
my view that it was not conveyed by Stephen's charter to
Geoffrey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_741" id="Ref_741" href="#Foot_741">[741]</a></span></p>

<p>The distinction between the "dedi et concessi" of the
"Tertius Denarius" clause and the "reddidi" and "concessi"
of those by which the king confirms to Geoffrey
his ancestral estates is one always to be noted. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
terms of what one may call this general confirmation are
remarkably comprehensive, going back as they do to the
days of King William and of the grantee's great-grandfather;
and the profusion of legal verbiage in which they
are enwrapped is worthy of later times. The charter also
illustrates the adaptation in Latin of the old Anglo-Saxon
<i>formulæ</i>, themselves the relics of those quaint jingles which
must bear witness to oral transmission in an archaic state
of society.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_742" id="Ref_742" href="#Foot_742">[742]</a></span></p>

<p>The release of the lien (upon three manors) which
Henry I. had held is a very curious feature. One of these
manors, Sawbridgeworth in Herts., is surveyed in Domesday
at great length. Its value had then sunk from £60
to £50; but early in the reign of Henry II., Earl Geoffrey
gave it in fee to Warine fitz Gerold, the chamberlain, "per
(<i>sic</i>) <small>LXXIIII</small> libratas terræ, singulas <small>XX</small> libratas pro servitio
unius militis."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_743" id="Ref_743" href="#Foot_743">[743]</a></span></p>

<p>Under this charter Earl Geoffrey held the dignity till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
his death, at which time we find him lord of more than
a hundred and fifty knights' fees. The earldom then
(1166) passed to his younger brother William, and did so,
as far as we know, without a fresh creation. For the
limitation, it is important to observe, in this as in other
early creations, is not restricted to heirs <i>of the body</i>—a
much later addition. As this point is of considerable
importance it may be as well here to compare the essential
words of inheritance in the three successive charters:—</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the earliest of these three—the
earliest of all our creation-charters—has the most
intensely hereditary ring, a fact at variance with the
favourite doctrine that the hereditary principle was a late
innovation, and ousted but slowly the official position. It
is further to be observed that the term "Comitatus," of
which the denotation in Scottish charters has been so long
and fiercely debated, has here the abstract signification
which it possesses in our own day, namely, that of the
dignity of an earl.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">When we think of their father's stormy career, it is
not a little strange to find these two successive Earls of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
Essex high in favour with the order-loving king, throughout
whose reign, for more than thirty years (1156-1189), we
find them honoured and trusted in his councils, in his
courts, and in his host. Of Earl William Miss Norgate
writes: "The son was as loyal as his father was faithless;
he seems, indeed, to have been a close personal friend of
the king, and to have well deserved his friendship."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_744" id="Ref_744" href="#Foot_744">[744]</a></span> His
fidelity was rewarded by the hand of the heiress of the
house of Aumâle, so that, already an earl in England, he
thus became, also, a count beyond the sea.</p>

<p>Yet well might men believe that the awful curse of
Heaven rested on this great and able house. At the very
moment when Earl William seemed to have attained the
pinnacle of power, when he had reached the point which
his father had reached some half a century before, then,
as in his father's case, the prize was snatched from his
grasp. King Richard, rightly prizing the earl's loyalty
and worth, announced his intention, at the Council of
Pipewell (September, 1189), of leaving him, with the
Bishop of Durham as his assessor, in charge of the kingdom,
as Justiciar, during his own absence in the East.
Such an office would have made the earl the foremost layman
in the realm. But before the time had come for
entering on his exalted duties, indeed within a few weeks
of his appointment, he was dead (November 14, 1189).</p>

<p>Like his brother Geoffrey before him, the earl died
childless; the vast estates of the house of Mandeville
passed to the descendants of his aunt; to his earldom
there was no heir.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_745" id="Ref_745" href="#Foot_745">[745]</a></span> Such was the end that awaited the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
ambition of Geoffrey de Mandeville. The earldom for
which he had schemed and striven, the strongholds on
which his power was based, the broad lands which owned
his sway—all were lost to his house. And as if by the
very irony of fate, Ernulf, his disinherited son, alone
continued the race, that there might not be wanting in
his hapless heirs an ever-standing monument to the greatness
at once of the guilt and of the fall of the man whose
story I have told.</p>

This charter may fairly be dated 1157-1158, on the following grounds.
It speaks of Warine fitz Gerold as the king's chamberlain, and as living.
But he died in the summer of 1158. It is, however, subsequent to Henry's
accession, because it was not till after that event that Fitz Gerold was enfeoffed
in Sawbridgeworth (<i>Liber Niger</i>), and also subsequent to 1155, because Geoffrey
occurs as earl. But as Maurice (de Tiretei) was not sheriff, within these
limits, till Michaelmas, 1157, we obtain the date 1157-1158.</p>

With this charter of Earl William may be compared another (<i>Cart.

Sawbridgeworth. The witnesses are "Willielmo de Ver, Asculfo Capellano,
Ricardo de Vercorol, Willelmo de Lisoris, David de Jarpouilla, Symone
fratre eius, Osberto filio Ricardi, Osberto de sancto Claro, Willelmo de Norhala,
Johanne de Rochella, Eustachio Camerario, Rogero et Simone clericis
Abbatis West'." The second and third witnesses are also found attesting
the earl's charter to the nuns of Greenfield (see p. 169). Compare further
"A charter of William, Earl of Essex" (<i>Eng. Hist. Review</i>, April, 1891).
"Asculfus (or Hasculfus) Capellanus" was the hero of the adventure, on
the earl's death, thus related by Dugdale: "A chaplain of the earl's, called
Hasculf, took out his best saddle-horse in the night, and rode to Chicksand,
where the Countess Rohese then resided," etc., etc.</p>

law, but Mr. W. H. Stevenson, correcting him, observed (<i>Academy</i>, June 29,
1889) that <i>litorum</i> referred to the seashore at Reculver (with which this grant
deals). Both these distinguished scholars are mistaken, for the words only
render the general formula: "by lande and by strande ('litorum'), by wode

The inheritance was in dispute for some time between his aunt's
younger son and the two daughters and co-heirs of her elder son deceased.
As the latter were eventually successful in their claim, there was no one
heir to whom the earldom could pass, as of right, under the charter of 1156
(accepting it as representing a limitation to heirs whatsoever). I have,
however, elsewhere suggested (Pipe-Roll Society: <i>Ancient Charters</i>, p. 99)
that the <i>salvo</i> to the elder of the two daughters of her <i>antenatio</i> may have
been connected with a claim to the dignity by her husband, in her right.</p>

<small>STEPHEN'S TREATY WITH THE LONDONERS.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_3">3</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">There</span>
are few more suggestive passages in the chronicles of
Stephen's reign than that which describes, in the <i>Gesta</i>, his
"pactio" with the citizens of London. This, because of the
striking resemblance between the "pactio ... mutuo juramento"
there described and the similar practice in those foreign
towns which enjoyed the rights of a "communa." Thus at
Bazas, in Aquitaine, "quum dominus rex venit apud Vasatum,
omnes cives Vasatenses jurant ei fidelitatem et obedientiam ...
similiter et rex et senescallus jurant dictis civibus Vasatensibus
quod sit bonus dominus eis et teneat consuetudines, et custodiat
eos de omni injuria de se et aliis pro posse suo." At Issigeac,
in the Perigord, it was (as was usual) the lord who had to
swear first before the citizens would do so: "en aital manieira
que'l seinher reis ... cant requerra et queste sagrament ...;
deu jurar a lor premeirament qu'il los defendra de si et d'autrui
de tot domnage, et las bonas custumas que il ont et que il
auront lor gardet et lor amelhoret, à bona fe, ... et que las
males lor oste et lor tolha de tot. Et en après, li prohome
deven li far lo sagrament sobredich, que'l garderon son corps
et sas gentz qui par lui esseron et sas dreituras de tort et de
forsa," etc., etc. At Bourg-sur-Mer, in Gascony, the clause
runs: "Dum dominus rex venit primo in Vasconia, juratur ab
eo, dum est sistens et coram senescallo suo (vel a senescallo
suo, dum ipse non est præsens, qui pro tempore veniet) quod
villam et jus custodiet et defendet et de se et de alio ab omni
injuria, et quod servabit foros et consuetudines suas. Nos
juramus ei et senescallo fidelitatem." So too at Bayonne, when
the Great Seneschal of Aquitaine, as representing the king,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
first arrived, he was called upon to swear by all the saints that
he would be a good and loyal lord; that he would protect the
citizens from all wrong and violence, either from himself or
from others; that he would preserve all their rights, customs,
and privileges, as granted them by the Kings of England and
Dukes of Guyenne, to the utmost of his power, so long as he
held the office, saving his fealty to the king.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_746" id="Ref_746" href="#Foot_746">[746]</a></span> When he had
done so, the mayor and jurats swore in their turn to him:—
"By those saints, will we be good, faithful, loyal, and obedient
to you; your life and limbs we will guard; good and loyal
counsel will we give you to the best of our power, and your
secrets will we keep."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_747" id="Ref_747" href="#Foot_747">[747]</a></span> These examples, which could be widely
paralleled, not only in municipalities, but also in the rural
commonwealths of the Pyrenean valleys, illustrate the principle
and uniform character of this "mutuum juramentum."</p>

<p>We are tempted then to ask whether it was not by some
such transaction as this that Stephen secured the adhesion of
the citizens. We shall find the Empress securing the city in
1141, after a formal "tractatus" at St. Albans with its
authorized representatives, and we know that the Conqueror
himself made some terms with the citizens before he entered
London. Comparing these facts with the reception at Winchester
of Stephen and the Empress in turn, it may fairly be
questioned whether we should accept the startling assertion in
the <i>Gesta</i> as literally correct. It would seem at least highly
probable that what the Londoners really claimed in 1135 was
not the right to elect a king of all England, but to choose their
own lord independently of the rest of the kingdom, and to do
so by a <i>separate negotiation</i> between himself and them. They
were not, in any case, prepared to receive the king as their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
lord unless he would first guarantee them the possession of all
their liberties. This semi-independent attitude, which was
virtually that assumed by Exeter when it attempted to treat
with the Conqueror, was distinctly foreign to the English polity
so far as our knowledge goes. There are faint hints, however,
in Domesday that such towns as London, York, Winchester,
and Exeter may have possessed a greater independence than
it has hitherto been the custom to believe.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX B.<br />
<small>THE APPEAL TO ROME IN 1136.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_8">8</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">One</span>
of the most interesting and curious discoveries that I have
made in the course of my researches has been the true story
of the appeal to Rome as arbiter between Stephen and Maud.
Considering the exceptional importance of this episode, in
many ways, it has received strangely little attention, with the
result that it has been imperfectly understood and almost
incredibly misdated.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman, working, in the <i>Norman Conquest</i>, from the
<i>Historia Pontificalis</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_748" id="Ref_748" href="#Foot_748">[748]</a></span> writes of this episode as taking place on
and in consequence of Stephen's attempt to secure the coronation
of Eustace in 1152.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_749" id="Ref_749" href="#Foot_749">[749]</a></span> Miss Norgate has gone into the
matter far more fully than Mr. Freeman, but at first assigned
the debate described in the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i> to "1151."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_750" id="Ref_750" href="#Foot_750">[750]</a></span></p>

<p>In so doing, she was guided merely by the <i>Historia</i> passage
itself, which she did not connect, as did Mr. Freeman, with the
episode of the proposed coronation in 1152. But on investigating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
the matter more closely, she was clearly led to reject
the date she had first given:—</p>

<p class="small">"From the way in which the trial is brought into the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i>,
it would at first sight seem to have taken place in 1151. But the presence of
Bishop Ulger of Angers and Roger of Chester, both of whom died in 1149,
and the account of the proceedings written by Gilbert Foliot to Brian fitz
Count, clearly prove the true date to be 1148."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_751" id="Ref_751" href="#Foot_751">[751]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the time of the bishop's death, Roger died, not in 1149,
but in April, 1148, and at Antioch, so that the chronology is no
less fatal to Miss Norgate's date than to Mr. Freeman's own.
But the additional evidence she obtains from Gilbert Foliot's
letter requires a special examination.</p>

<p>The sequence of events at which she arrives is this:—</p>

<p>(1) Theobald goes, in defiance of Stephen, to the council
convened at Rheims by Eugenius III. for Mid-Lent Sunday,
(March) 1148 (N.S.).</p>

<p>(2) Stephen forfeits Theobald, and is threatened in consequence
by the Pope.</p>

<p>(3) Geoffrey of Anjou, thereupon, challenges Stephen "to
an investigation of his claims before the papal court." Stephen,
in reply, calls on Geoffrey to surrender Normandy "before he
would agree to any further proceeding in the matter."</p>

<p>(4) Geoffrey surrenders Normandy—but to his son Henry,
and Stephen "appears to have consented, as if in desperation,
to the proposed trial at Rome."</p>

<p>(5) "The trial" takes place, as recorded in the <i>Historia
Pontificalis</i>, and is attended, <i>inter alios</i>, by Gilbert Foliot, Abbot
of Gloucester, who had obtained "the succession to the vacant
see" of Hereford at the Council of Rheims, and had added, in
consequence, to his style the words "et Herefordiensis ecclesiæ
mandato Domini Papæ vicarius."</p>

<p>(6) Gilbert Foliot writes the letter to Brian fitz Count,
reviewing the treatise which Brian had just composed in
support of the claims of the Empress, and alluding to the above
"trial" at Rome which he (Gilbert) had attended.</p>

<p>(7) Gilbert Foliot is consecrated Bishop of Hereford by
Theobald, at St. Omer, in September (1148).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_752" id="Ref_752" href="#Foot_752">[752]</a></span></p>

<p>Of these events, the cession of Normandy by Geoffrey to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
son Henry belongs, as Mr. Howlett has pointed out, not to 1148,
but to 1150 or 1151.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_753" id="Ref_753" href="#Foot_753">[753]</a></span> This, however, scarcely affects Miss
Norgate's sequence of events. It is when we turn to Foliot's
letter that our suspicions begin to be aroused. Although Dr.
Giles has placed it at the end of those letters which belong to
the period of his rule as abbot (1139-1148), we must be struck
by the fact that if (as Miss Norgate holds) it was written just
before his consecration as Bishop of Hereford, the style would
have been "elect of Hereford," or, at least, "Vicar of the
Diocese (<i>ut supra</i>)," instead of "Abbot of Gloucester" only.
Moreover, as Henry was <i>ex hypothesi</i> now Duke of Normandy,
the "trial" would have been, surely, of his own claims, not of
those of his mother, who had virtually retired in his favour.
Lastly, we must see that the date assigned by her to this
"trial" at Rome (1148) is a mere hypothesis unsupported by
any direct evidence.</p>

<p>But, indeed, we have only to read the letter and the <i>Historia
Pontificalis</i> to see that they must have been perused with almost
incredible carelessness. For Gilbert Foliot distinctly mentions
(<i>a</i>) that he is writing in the time of Pope Celestine,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_754" id="Ref_754" href="#Foot_754">[754]</a></span> (<i>b</i>) that
the "trial" took place under Pope Innocent.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_755" id="Ref_755" href="#Foot_755">[755]</a></span> Now, Celestine
died in March, 1144, and his predecessor Innocent had died in
September, 1143. The letter, therefore, must have been written
within these six months, and the "trial" at Rome must have
taken place before September 24, 1143. This being clear, we
naturally ask:—How came Innocent thus to hear the case
argued, when he had admittedly "confirmed" Stephen at the
very beginning of his reign? Having decided the question at
the outset, how could he ignore that decision, and begin, as it
were, <i>de novo</i>? Moreover, Stephen's champion is described by
the <i>Historia</i> writer as Arnulf, Archdeacon of Séez, afterwards
Bishop of Lisieux. Now, Miss Norgate, with her usual care, fixes
the date of his elevation to the see as 1141.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_756" id="Ref_756" href="#Foot_756">[756]</a></span> A council, therefore,
which he attended as archdeacon must, on her own showing,
be not later than this.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_757" id="Ref_757" href="#Foot_757">[757]</a></span> Lastly, now that we know the council
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
to be previous to 1141, do not the words of the writer—"Magno
illi conventui cum domino et patre nostro domino abbate Cluniacensi
interfui et ego Cluniacensium minimus"—suggest that
it was, further, previous to his becoming Abbot of Gloucester
in 1139? Turning again to the passage in the <i>Historia Pontificalis</i>
(41), we find that, in the light of the above evidence, its
meaning is beyond dispute. So, indeed, it should be of itself,
but for a most incomprehensible blunder by which two passages
of the <i>narrative</i> are printed in Pertz as part of the arguments
advanced in the debate. The fact is that the writer of the
<i>Historia</i>, when he comes to the proposal to crown Eustace, is
anxious to show us how the matter stood by tracing the
attitude of the Papacy to Stephen since the beginning of his
reign. He, therefore, takes us right back to the year of the
king's accession, and tells us how, and to what extent, his claim
came to be confirmed.</p>

<p>This discovery at once explains Gilbert Foliot's expression.
For, the trial at Rome taking place, as I shall show, early in
1136, he attended it, not as Abbot of Gloucester, but merely as
"minimus Cluniacensium," in attendance on his famous abbot,
Peter the Venerable (1122-1158). It may have been as prior
("claustral" prior?) of the abbey that he thus attended him,
for we know from himself that he had held that office.</p>

<p>Everything now fits into place. We find that, following in
her grandfather's footsteps, Maud at once appealed to Rome
against Stephen's usurpation, charging him, precisely as William,
in his day, had charged Harold, (1) with defrauding her of her
rightful inheritance, (2) with breach of his oath. Stephen,
when he had overcome the scruples of William of Corbeuil, and
had secured coronation at his hands, hastened to take his next
step by despatching to Rome three envoys to plead his cause
before the pope. These envoys were Roger, Bishop of Chester,
Arnulf, Archdeacon of Séez (the spokesman of the party), and
"Lovel," a clerk of Archbishop William.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_758" id="Ref_758" href="#Foot_758">[758]</a></span> This last was, of
course, intended to represent his master in the matter, and to
justify his action in crowning Stephen by explaining the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
grounds on which his scruples had been overruled. The
envoys were abundantly supplied with the requisite motive
power—or, shall we say, the oil for lubricating the wheels of
the Curia?—from the hoarded treasure of the dead king, which
was now in his successor's hands. The pope resolved that so
important a cause required no ordinary tribunal: he convoked
for the purpose a great council, and among those by whom it
was attended was Peter, Abbot of Cluny, with Gilbert Foliot
in his train.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_759" id="Ref_759" href="#Foot_759">[759]</a></span></p>

<p>The name of Cluny leads me to break the thread for a
moment for the purpose of insisting on the important fact that
the sympathies of the house, under its then abbot, must have
been with the Angevin cause. This is certain from the documents
printed by Sir George Duckett,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_760" id="Ref_760" href="#Foot_760">[760]</a></span> especially from the
Mandatory Epistle of this same Abbot Peter relating to the
Empress.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_761" id="Ref_761" href="#Foot_761">[761]</a></span> We have here, I think, the probable explanation
of the energy with which that cause was espoused by Gilbert
Foliot.</p>

<p>To return to the council. The case for the prosecution, as
we might term it, was opened by the Bishop of Angers, who
charged Stephen both with perjury, that is, with breaking the
oath he had sworn to Henry I., and with usurpation in seizing
the throne to the detriment of the rightful heir.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_762" id="Ref_762" href="#Foot_762">[762]</a></span> Stephen's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
supporters, with Arnulf at their head, met these charges by a
defence, the two reports of which are not in absolute harmony.
It is quite certain that to the charge of usurpation they retorted
that the Empress was the offspring of an unlawful alliance, and
had, therefore, suffered no wrong.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_763" id="Ref_763" href="#Foot_763">[763]</a></span> But how they disposed of
the oath is not so clear. According to Gilbert Foliot, whose
account we may safely follow, they advanced the subtle and
ingenious plea that fidelity had only been sworn to the Empress
as heir ("sicut heredi") to the throne, and since (they urged)
she was not such heir (for the reason given above), the oath
was <i>ipso facto</i> void, and the charge fell to the ground.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_764" id="Ref_764" href="#Foot_764">[764]</a></span> The
other writer asserts that the defence was based, first, on the
plea that the oath had been forcibly extorted, and, second, on
the cunning pretence that the king had reserved to himself
the right of appointing another heir, and had exercised that
right on his deathbed, to the extent of disinheriting the
Empress and nominating Stephen in her stead.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_765" id="Ref_765" href="#Foot_765">[765]</a></span></p>

<p>A careful study of the two versions has led me to believe
that both writers were, probably, right in their facts. Gilbert
Foliot would be the last man to invent an argument in favour
of Stephen, nor would the other writer have any inducement to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
do so, writing (as he did) long after that king's death. Moreover,
the pleas that (1) the oath had been extorted, (2) Henry I.
had released his barons from its obligation, are precisely those
which the author of the <i>Gesta</i> and William of Malmesbury<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_766" id="Ref_766" href="#Foot_766">[766]</a></span>
respectively mention as being advanced on Stephen's behalf.
Lastly, we have yet another plea advanced by Bishop Roger of
Salisbury, namely, that, so far as he was himself concerned, he
looked on the re-marriage of the Empress, without the consent
of the Great Council, as absolving him from his oath. Now, all
this points to one conclusion. The thorn in the side of Stephen
and of his friends was, clearly, this unlucky oath. Their
various attempts to excuse its breach betray their consciousness
of the fact. More especially was this the case before a spiritual
court. Hence their ingenious endeavour, described by Gilbert
Foliot, to keep the oath in the background as the lesser of the
two points. Hence, too, their accumulated pleas. First, they
urge that the oath was void because the Empress was not the
heir; then, that it was void, because extorted; lastly, that it was
void because the dying king had released them from their
obligation. Such an argument as this speaks for itself.</p>

<p>The only point on which the two witnesses do, at first sight,
differ, is the attitude taken by the Bishop of Angers with regard
to the plea that the Empress was not of legitimate birth.
Did he contravene this plea? The <i>Historia</i> asserts that when
Stephen's advocates had stated the case for the defence, the
bishop rose and traversed their pleadings, rejecting them one by
one. But Gilbert, writing to Brian fitz Count, admits that the
attack on the birth of the Empress (the only argument which
he discusses) had not been replied to.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_767" id="Ref_767" href="#Foot_767">[767]</a></span> Now, the version found
in the <i>Historia</i>, though composed much later, is a more detailed
account, and bears the stamp of truth. Yet Gilbert's admission
to his friend and ally betrays an uneasy consciousness that the
charge had not been disposed of. For he asks him to suggest
an effectual reply, and proceeds to suggest one himself.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_768" id="Ref_768" href="#Foot_768">[768]</a></span> He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
relies on St. Anselm's consent to her parents' marriage. We
have here possibly the clue we seek. For the Bishop of Angers,
in his speech, as given by the writer of the <i>Historia</i>, had not
alluded to St. Anselm's consent.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_769" id="Ref_769" href="#Foot_769">[769]</a></span> Perhaps he was taken by
surprise, and had not expected the plea.</p>

<p>Stephen's advocates seem, from a hint of Gilbert Foliot,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_770" id="Ref_770" href="#Foot_770">[770]</a></span> to
have simply "stampeded the convention" (<i>conventus</i>), and the
wrath of the Angevin champion rose to a white heat.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_771" id="Ref_771" href="#Foot_771">[771]</a></span> The
pope commanded that the wrangling should cease, and announced
that he would neither pass sentence nor allow the trial to be
adjourned. This was equivalent to a verdict that the king was
not guilty, and was duly followed by a letter to Stephen confirming
him in his possession of the kingdom and the duchy.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_772" id="Ref_772" href="#Foot_772">[772]</a></span></p>

<p>Seeing that he had lost his case, the aged Bishop of Angers
relieved his feelings by a bitter jest at the cost of the heir of
St. Peter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_773" id="Ref_773" href="#Foot_773">[773]</a></span></p>

<p>But we are more immediately concerned with that letter by
which the pope (the writer tells us) confirmed Stephen in
possession. For this connecting link is no other than the letter
which meets us in the pages of Richard of Hexham.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_774" id="Ref_774" href="#Foot_774">[774]</a></span></p>

<p>Its relevant portion runs thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Nos cognoscentes vota tantorum virorum in personam tuam, præeunte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
divina gratia, convenisse, pro spe etiam certa,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_775" id="Ref_775" href="#Foot_775">[775]</a></span> et [quia] beato Petro in ipsa
consecrationis tuæ die obedientiam et reverentiam promisisse, et quia de
præfati regis prosapia prope posito gradu originem traxisse dinosceris, quod
de te factum est gratum habentes, te in specialem beati Petri et sanctæ
Romanæ ecclesie filium affectione paterna recipimus, et in eadem honoris
et familiaritatis prærogativa, qua predecessor tuus egregiæ recordationis
Henricus a nobis coronabatur, te propensius volumus retinere."</p>

<p class="nodent">The chronicler, observing that Stephen was "his et aliis modis
in regno Angliæ confirmatus," passes straight from this letter
to the King's Oxford charter, in which he describes himself as
"ab Innocentio sanctæ Romanæ sedis pontifice confirmatus."
Of this "confirmation," as we find it styled by the author of
the <i>Historia</i>, by Richard of Hexham, by John of Hexham,
and lastly, by Stephen himself, I speak more fully in the text.
For the present the point to be grasped is that (1) the "conventus"
at Rome was previous to (2) this letter of the pope,
which was previous itself to (3) Stephen's charter, which is
assigned to the spring (after Easter) of 1136. Thus we arrive
at the fact that the council and debate at Rome belong to the
early months of 1136.</p>

<p>To complete while we are about it the explanation of the
<i>Historia</i> narrative, we will now take the second passage which
has been erroneously printed in Pertz—</p>

<p class="small">"Postea, cum prefatus Guido cardinalis promoveretur in papam Celestinum,
favore imperatricis scripsit domno Theobaldo Cantuarensi archiepiscopo
inhibens ne qua fieret innovatio in regno Anglie circa coronam, quia res erat
litigiosa cujus translatio jure reprobata est. Successores eius papæ Lucius et
Eugenius eandem prohibitionem innovaverunt."</p>

<p class="nodent">This passage is absurdly given as part of Bishop Ulger's sneer.</p>

<p>The above cardinal is Guy, cardinal priest of St. Mark,
referred to in the previous misplaced passage as opposing the
confirmation of Stephen. Observe here that three writers
allude quite independently to his sympathy with the Angevin
cause. These are—(1) the writer (<i>ut supra</i>) of the <i>Historia
Pontificalis</i>; (2) Gilbert Foliot, who speaks of him, when pope,
as "favente parti huic domino papa Celestino," and (3) John
of Hexham, who describes him as "Alumpnus Andegavensium."
A coincidence of testimony, so striking as this, strengthens the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
authority of all three, including that of the writer of the <i>Historia
Pontificalis</i>.</p>

<p>The step taken by Pope Celestine was based on the alleged
doubt in which his predecessor had left the question. It was,
he held, still "res litigiosa," and, therefore, without reversing
the action of Innocent in the matter, he felt free to forbid any
further step in advance. His instructions to that effect, to the
primate, were duly renewed by his successors, and covered,
when the time arrived, the case of the coronation of Eustace
as being an "innovatio in regno Anglie circa coronam."
Stephen had, indeed, been confirmed as king, and this could not
be undone. But that confirmation did not extend to the son of
the "perjured" king.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_776" id="Ref_776" href="#Foot_776">[776]</a></span></p>

<p>With the character and meaning of the "confirmation" obtained
by Stephen from the pope, I have dealt in the body of
this work. There are, however, a few minor points which had
better be disposed of here. Of these the first is Miss Norgate's
contention that when, in 1148, Stephen met Geoffrey's challenge
to submit his claims to Rome, "by a counter challenge calling
upon Geoffrey to give up his equally ill-gotten duchy before
he would agree to any further proceeding in the matter,"</p>

<p class="small">"Geoffrey took him at his word, but in a way which he was far from
desiring. He did give up the duchy of Normandy, by making it over to his
own son, Henry Fitz-Empress."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_777" id="Ref_777" href="#Foot_777">[777]</a></span></p>

<p>A reference to the passage in the <i>Historia</i><span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_778" id="Ref_778" href="#Foot_778">[778]</a></span> on which Miss
Norgate relies, will show at once that Geoffrey, on receiving
the counter-challenge, abandoned all thought of carrying the
matter further.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_779" id="Ref_779" href="#Foot_779">[779]</a></span> It also incidentally proves that Geoffrey had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">{260}</a></span>
refused admission to his dominions to either pope or legate.
This is a fact of interest.</p>

<p>This was not the only occasion on which Stephen's "recognition"
by the pope stood him in good stead. At the crisis of
1141, the sensitive conscience of Archbishop Theobald had prevented
his transferring his allegiance to the Empress, badly
though Stephen had treated him, till he received permission
from the Lord's anointed to follow in the footsteps of his brother
prelates.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_780" id="Ref_780" href="#Foot_780">[780]</a></span></p>

<p>The loyal primate explained the position when Gilbert
Foliot had enraged the Angevins by doing homage to Stephen
for the see of Hereford. Wholly Angevin though they were
in their sympathies, the prelates maintained that they were
bound as Churchmen to follow the pope's ruling, and that the
Papacy had "received" Stephen as king.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_781" id="Ref_781" href="#Foot_781">[781]</a></span></p>

<p>Another point deserving notice is the choice of Arnulf,
afterwards the well-known Bishop of Lisieux, as Stephen's
chief envoy in 1136. For Miss Norgate, oddly enough, misses
this point in her sketch of this distinguished man's career.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_782" id="Ref_782" href="#Foot_782">[782]</a></span>
She has nothing to say of his doings between his <i>Tractatus de
Schismate</i>, "about 1130," and his appointment to the see of
Lisieux in 1141, from which date "for the next forty years
there was hardly a diplomatic transaction of any kind, ecclesiastical
or secular, in England or in Gaul, in which he was
not at some moment or in some way or other concerned."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_783" id="Ref_783" href="#Foot_783">[783]</a></span> This,
therefore, constitutes a welcome addition to his career, and,
moreover, gives us the reason of Geoffrey's aversion to him,
when duke, and of the "heavy price" with which his favour
had to be bought by Arnulf.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_784" id="Ref_784" href="#Foot_784">[784]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
The last point concerns the "most interesting and valuable"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_785" id="Ref_785" href="#Foot_785">[785]</a></span>
letter from Gilbert Foliot to Brian fitz Count. A careful
perusal of this composition has led me to believe, from internal
evidence, that it refers not (as Miss Norgate puts it) to a
"book" by Brian fitz Count, or "a defence of his Lady's rights
in the shape of a little treatise,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_786" id="Ref_786" href="#Foot_786">[786]</a></span> but to a justification of his
own conduct in reply to hostile criticism. And I venture to
think that so far from this composition being "unhappily lost,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_787" id="Ref_787" href="#Foot_787">[787]</a></span>
it may be, and probably is, no other than that lengthy epistle
from Brian to the Bishop of Winchester, of which a copy was
entered in Richard de Bury's <i>Liber Epistolaris</i>. And there,
happily, it is still preserved.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_788" id="Ref_788" href="#Foot_788">[788]</a></span> This can only be decided when
the contents of that epistle are made accessible to the public,
as they should have been before now.</p>

<p>To resume. I have now established these facts. The "trial"
at Rome took place, not, as Mr. Freeman assumes, in 1152, nor,
as Miss Norgate argues, in 1148, but early in 1136. The letter
of Gilbert Foliot, in which he refers to it, was written, not in
1148, but late in 1143 or early in 1144. The whole of Miss
Norgate's sequence of events (i. 369, 370) breaks down entirely.
The great debate before the pope at Rome was not the result
of Stephen's attempt to get Eustace crowned, nor of Geoffrey's
challenge to Stephen by the mouth of Bishop Miles, but of the
charge brought against Stephen at the very outset of his reign.
The true story of this debate and of Stephen's "confirmation,"
by the pope, as king is here set forth for the first time, and
throws on the whole chain of events a light entirely new.</p>

eique velum abstulerat" (<i>Hist. Pontif.</i>). "Imperatricem, de qua loquitur,
non de legitimo matrimonio ortam denuntiamus. Deviavit a legitimo tramite
Henricus rex, et quam non licebat sibi junxit matrimonio, unde istius sunt

"Sublato enim jure principali, necessario tollitur et secundarium. In

inducit et ab hoc totum illud dependet, quod de juramento subjungitur.
Imperatrici namque sicut heredi juramentum factum fuisse pronunciat.

poterat enim esse ut ei de uxore filius nasceretur. Postremo subjecit
quod rex Henricus mutaverat voluntatem et in extremis agens filium sororis

Mr. Howlett has duly pointed out that Geoffrey did not, as Miss Norgate
imagines, hand over Normandy to his son in consequence of this challenge;
but I would point out further that Stephen demanded not merely the surrender
of Normandy, but also that of the <i>English</i> districts then under Angevin
sway ("Hoc retulit responsum: quod rex <i>utrumque</i> honorem et jure suo
<i>et ecclesie Romane auctoritate</i> adeptus erat, <i>nec refugerat stare judicio apostolicæ
sedis</i>, quando eum comes violenter ducatu spoliavit et parte regni.

The stinging taunts of the Bishop of Angers on Arnulf's humble origin,
as given in the <i>Hist. Pontif.</i>, are of great importance in their bearing on
Henry I.'s policy of raising men to power "from the dust." They should
be compared with the well-known sneer of Ordericus (see p. 111).</p>

There were thus assembled at the Easter court of 1136
the two primates of England and twelve of their suffragans,
and the primate of Normandy, with four of his—nineteen prelates
in all. Next to these, in order of precedence, were Henry, the
king's nephew,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_791" id="Ref_791" href="#Foot_791">[791]</a></span> Henry, son of the King of Scots, and Reginald,
afterwards Earl of Cornwall, whose presence, as a son of the
late king, was of importance in the absence of the Earl of
Gloucester. The names in all three lists repay careful study.
Among them we find all those of the leading supporters of the
Empress in the future, while in Robert de Ferrers, William de
Aumale, and Geoffrey de Mandeville, we recognize three of
those who were to receive earldoms from Stephen. The style
and place of William de Aumale deserves special notice,
because they prove that he did not, as is supposed, enjoy
comital rank at the time.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_792" id="Ref_792" href="#Foot_792">[792]</a></span> This fact, further on, will have an
important bearing. So, too, Simon de St. Liz ("de Silva
Necta") was clearly not an earl at the time of these charters.
It is believed indeed that he was Earl of Northampton, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
Henry of Scotland was Earl of Huntingdon. But it is clear
that when Henry received from Stephen, as he had just done,
Waltheof's earldom, that grant must have comprised Northampton
as well as Huntingdon; and I have seen other evidence
pointing to the same conclusion. In after years, when Simon
was as loyal as the Scotch court was hostile to Stephen, he
may well have received the earldom of Northampton from the
king he served so well. But for the present, Henry of Scotland
was in high favour with Stephen, so high that the jealousy of
the Earl of Chester, stirred by the alienation of Carlisle, blazed
forth at this very court.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_793" id="Ref_793" href="#Foot_793">[793]</a></span> Their mention of Ranulf's presence,
as of Henry's, confirms the authenticity of our charters.</p>

<p>The document with which they should be compared is the
charter granted to the church of Salisbury by Henry I. at his
Northampton council in 1131 (September 8).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_794" id="Ref_794" href="#Foot_794">[794]</a></span> Its witnesses
are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, ten bishops
(Gilbert of London, Henry of Winchester, Alexander of
Lincoln, John of Rochester, Seffrid of Chichester, William
of Exeter, Robert of Hereford, Symon of Worcester, Roger of
"Chester," and Ebrard of Norwich), seven abbots (Anscher
of Reading, Ingulf of Abingdon, Walter of Gloucester, Geoffrey
of St. Albans, Herbert of Westminster, Warner of Battle, and
Hugh of St. Augustine's), Geoffrey the chancellor,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_795" id="Ref_795" href="#Foot_795">[795]</a></span> with
Robert "de Sigillo,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_796" id="Ref_796" href="#Foot_796">[796]</a></span> and Nigel the Bishop of Salisbury's
nephew,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_797" id="Ref_797" href="#Foot_797">[797]</a></span> five earls (Robert of Gloucester, William of Warenne,
Randulf of Chester, Robert of Leicester, and Roger of Warwick),
nineteen barons (Brian fitz Count, Miles de Gloucester, Hugh
Bigod, Humfrey de Bohun, Payne fitz John, Geoffrey de
Clinton, William de Pont de l'Arche, Richard Basset, Aubrey
de Ver, Richard fitz Gilbert, Roger fitz Richard, Walter fitz
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
Richard, Walter de Gant, Robert de Ferrers, William Peverel
of Nottingham, Baldwin de Redvers, Walter de Salisbury,
William de Moion, Robert de Arundel), forty-six in all. In
many ways a very noteworthy list, and not least in its likeness
to the future House of Lords, with its strong clerical element.
It is impossible to comment on all the magnates here assembled
at Henry's court, many of whom we meet with again, but
attention may be called to the significant fact that nine of the
earldoms created under Stephen were bestowed on houses
represented among the nineteen barons named above.<span class="fnanchor"><a

This list is taken from that in Stubbs' <i>Select Charters</i>, which is derived,
through the <i>Statutes of the Realm</i>, from a copy at Exeter Cathedral. There
is another version in Richard of Hexham (ed. Howlett, pp. 149, 150), in
which Payn fitz John is omitted and <i>Hugh</i> de St. Clare entered in error for
<i>Hamon</i>. But the reading "Silvanecta" (for "Saint liz") is confirmed by
Charter No. I., as well as by a charter in <i>Cott. MSS.</i>, Nero, C. iii. (fol. 177).
Both versions of this list are questionable as to the second "pincerna," the
statutes reading "Eudone Mart'," while Richard gives "Martel de Alb'."</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_790" id="Foot_790" href="#Ref_790">[790]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This list is here printed as it is given by Hearne, but the order of the
names, of course, is wholly erroneous, the prelates being placed low down
instead of at the head. The right order would be prelates, chancellor (and
chaplain), the "royalties," the earls, the household officers, and the
"barones." But it would not be safe to rearrange the names in the absence
of the original charter, in which they probably stood in parallel columns.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_791" id="Foot_791" href="#Ref_791">[791]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Henry de Soilli (or Sully), son of Stephen's brother William. I find him
attesting a charter of Stephen abroad, subsequently, as "H. de Soilli, nepote
regis." He was a monk, and failing to obtain the bishopric of Salisbury or
the archbishopric of York, in 1140, was consoled with the Abbey of Fécamp.</p>

propositions are fairly warranted by the statements of one or
two chroniclers may be at once frankly conceded; that they
are true in fact, we shall now find, may be denied without
hesitation.</p>

<p>Let us first examine Dr. Stubbs's view as set forth in his
own words:—</p>

<td>"Not satisfied with putting this
weapon into the hands of his enemies,
he provoked their pride and jealousy
by conferring the title of earl upon
some of those whom he trusted most
implicitly, irrespective of the means
which they might have of supporting
their new dignity. Their poverty was
relieved by pensions drawn from the
Exchequer.... Stephen, almost before
the struggle for the crown had
begun, attempted to strengthen his
party by a creation of new earls. To
these the third penny of the county
was given, and their connection with
the district from which the title was
taken was generally confined to this
comparatively small endowment, the
rest of their provision being furnished
by pensions on the Exchequer" (<i>Const.
Hist.</i>, i. 324, 362).</td>

<td>"Stephen also would have a court
of great earls, but in trying to make
himself friends he raised up persistent
enemies. He raised new men
to new earldoms, but as he had no
spare domains to bestow, he endowed
them with pensions charged on the
Exchequer ... the new and unsubstantial
earldoms provoked the real
earls to further hostility; and the
newly created lords demanded of the
king new privileges as the reward
and security for their continued services"

<p>Now, these "pensions on the Exchequer" must, I fear, be
dismissed at once as having an existence only in a misapprehension
of the writer. Indeed, if the Exchequer machinery had
broken down, as he holds, it is difficult to see of what value
these pensions would be. But in any case, it is absolutely
certain that such grants as were made were alienations of lands
and rents, and not "pensions" at all.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_802" id="Ref_802" href="#Foot_802">[802]</a></span> The passages bearing
on these grants are as follows. Robert de Torigny (<i>alias</i> "De
Monte") states that Stephen "omnia pene ad fiscum pertinentia
minus caute distribuerat," and that Henry, on his accession,
"cœpit revocare in jus proprium urbes, castella, villas, quæ ad
coronam regni pertinebant."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_803" id="Ref_803" href="#Foot_803">[803]</a></span> William of Newburgh writes:—</p>

<p class="small">"Considerans autem Rex [Henricus] quod regii redditus breves essent,
qui avito tempore uberes fuerant, eo quod regia dominica per mollitiem regis
Stephani ad alia multosque dominos majori ex parte migrassent, præcepit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
ea cum omni integritate a quibuscunque detentioribus resignari, et in jus
statumque pristinum revocari."</p>

<p>In the vigorous words of William of Malmesbury:—</p>

<p class="small">"Multi siquidem ... a rege, hi prædia, hi castella, postremo quæcumque
semel collibuisset, petere non verebantur; ... Denique multos etiam
comites, qui ante non fuerant, instituit, applicitis possessionibus et redditibus
quæ proprio jure regi competebant."</p>

<p>It is on this last passage that Dr. Stubbs specially relies;
but a careful comparison of this with the two preceding extracts
will show that in none of them are "pensions" spoken of. The
grants, as indeed charters prove, always consisted of actual
estates.</p>

<p>The next point is that these alienations were, for the most
part, made in favour not of "fiscal earls," but, on the contrary,
in favour of those who were not created earls.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_804" id="Ref_804" href="#Foot_804">[804]</a></span> There is reason
to believe, from such evidence as we have, that, in this matter,
the Empress was a worse offender than the king, while their
immaculate successor, as his Pipe-Rolls show, was perhaps the
worst of the three. It is, at any rate, a remarkable fact that
the only known charter by which Stephen creates an earldom—being
that to Geoffrey de Mandeville (1140)—does not grant
a pennyworth of land, while the largest grantee of lands known
to us, namely, William d'Ypres, was never created an earl.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_805" id="Ref_805" href="#Foot_805">[805]</a></span>
Then, again, as to "the third penny." It is not even mentioned
in the above creation-charter, and there is no evidence that
"the third penny of the county was given" to all Stephen's
earls; indeed, as I have elsewhere shown, it was probably
limited to a few (see Appendix H).</p>

<p>The fact is that the whole view is based on the radically
false assumption of the "poverty" of Stephen's earls. The
idea that his earls were taken from the ranks is a most extraordinary
delusion. They belonged, in the main, to that class
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
of magnates from whom, both before and after his time, the
earls were usually drawn. Dr. Stubbs's own words are in
themselves destructive of his view:—</p>

<p class="small">"Stephen made Hugh Bigod Earl of Norfolk, Aubrey de Vere Earl of
Oxford, Geoffrey de Mandeville Earl of Essex, Richard de Clare Earl of
Hertford, William of Aumâle Earl of Yorkshire, Gilbert de Clare Earl
of Pembroke, Robert de Ferrers Earl of Derby, and Hugh de Beaumont
Earl of Bedford."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_806" id="Ref_806" href="#Foot_806">[806]</a></span></p>

<p>Were such nobles as these "new men"? Had <i>their</i>
"poverty" to be "relieved"? Why, their very names are
enough; they are those of the noblest and wealthiest houses in
the baronage of Stephen's realm. Even the last, Hugh de
Beaumont, though not the head of his house, had two elder
brothers earls at the time, nor was it proposed to create him
an earl till, by possession of the Beauchamp fief, he should be
qualified to take his place among the great landowners of the
day.</p>

<p>Having thus, I hope, completely disposed of this strange
delusion, and shown that Stephen selected his earls from the
same class as other kings, I now approach the alleged deposition
of the earls created by the Empress and himself, on the
accession of Henry II.</p>

<p>I would venture, on the strength of special research, to
make several alterations in the lists given by Dr. Stubbs.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_807" id="Ref_807" href="#Foot_807">[807]</a></span></p>

<p>The earldoms he assigns to Stephen are these:—</p>

<div class="earl">

<ul>
 <li><span class="smc">Norfolk.</span> Hugh Bigod (before 1153).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Oxford.</span> Aubrey de Vere (<i>questionable</i>).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Essex.</span> Geoffrey de Mandeville (before 1143).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Hertford.</span> Richard de Clare (uncertain).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Yorkshire.</span> William of Aumâle (1138).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Pembroke.</span> Gilbert de Clare (1138).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Derby.</span> Robert de Ferrers (1138).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Bedford.</span> Hugh de Beaumont.</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Kent.</span> William of Ypres (<i>questionable</i>).</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p class="nodent">From these we must at once deduct the two admitted to be
"questionable:" William of Ypres, because I am enabled to state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
absolutely, from my own knowledge of charters, that he never
received an English earldom,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_808" id="Ref_808" href="#Foot_808">[808]</a></span> and Aubrey de Vere, because
there is no evidence whatever that Stephen created him an earl.
On the other hand, we must add the earldoms of Arundel (or
Chichester or Sussex) and of Lincoln.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_809" id="Ref_809" href="#Foot_809">[809]</a></span> When thus corrected,
the list will run:—</p>

<div class="earl">

<ul>
 <li><span class="smc">Derby.</span> Robert de Ferrers (1138).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Yorkshire.</span> William of Aumâle (1138).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Pembroke.</span> Gilbert de Clare (1138).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Essex.</span> Geoffrey de Mandeville (1140).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Lincoln.</span> William de Roumare (? 1139-1140).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Norfolk.</span> Hugh Bigod (before February, 1141).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Arundel.</span> William de Albini (before Christmas, 1141).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Hertford.</span> Gilbert de Clare<span class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_810" id="Ref_810"
           href="#Foot_810">[810]</a></span> (before Christmas, 1141).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Bedford.</span> Hugh de Beaumont (? 1138).</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>A glance at this list will show how familiar are these titles
to our ears, and how powerful were the houses on which they
were bestowed. With the exception of the last, which had a
transitory existence, the names of these great earldoms became
household words.</p>

<p>Turning now to the earldoms of the Empress, and confining
ourselves to new creations, we obtain the following list:—</p>

<div class="earl">

<ul>
 <li><span class="smc">Cornwall.</span> Reginald fitz Roy (? 1141).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Devon.</span> Baldwin de Redvers (before June, 1141).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Dorset</span> (or <span class="smc">Somerset</span>). William de Mohun (before June, 1141).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Hereford.</span> Miles of Gloucester (July, 1141).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Oxford.</span> Aubrey de Vere (1142).</li>
 <li><span class="smc">Wiltshire</span> ("<span class="smc">Salisbury</span>"). Patrick of Salisbury (in or before 1149).<span
           class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_811" id="Ref_811"
                 href="#Foot_811">[811]</a></span></li>
</ul>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
This varies from Dr. Stubbs's list in omitting <span class="smc">Essex</span>
(Geoffrey de Mandeville) as only a confirmation, and adding
<span class="smc">Devon</span> (Baldwin de Redvers), an earldom which is always,
but erroneously, stated to have been conferred upon Baldwin's
father <i>temp.</i> Henry I.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_812" id="Ref_812" href="#Foot_812">[812]</a></span> Of these creations, Hereford is the
one of which the facts are best ascertained, while Dorset or
Somerset is that of which least is known.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_813" id="Ref_813" href="#Foot_813">[813]</a></span></p>

<p>The merest glance at these two lists is sufficient to show
that the titles conferred by the rival competitors for the crown
were chosen from those portions of the realm in which their
strength respectively lay. Nor do they seem to have encroached
upon the sphere of one another by assigning to the same county
rival earls. This is an important fact to note, and it leads us
to this further observation, that, contrary to the view advanced
by Dr. Stubbs, the earls created in this reign took their title,
wherever possible, from the counties in which lay their chief
territorial strength. Of the earldoms existing at the death
of Henry (Chester, Leicester, Warwick, Gloucester, Surrey,
[Northampton?], Huntingdon, and Buckingham<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_814" id="Ref_814" href="#Foot_814">[814]</a></span>), Surrey was
the one glaring exception to this important rule. Under
Stephen and Matilda, in these two lists, we have fifteen new
earls, of whom almost all take their titles in accordance with
this same rule. Hugh Bigod, Robert de Ferrers, William
of Aumâle, Geoffrey de Mandeville, William de Albini, William
de Roumare, William de Mohun, Baldwin de Redvers, Patrick
of Salisbury, are all instances in point. The only exceptions
suggest the conclusion that where a newly created earl could
not take for his title the county in which his chief possessions
lay, he chose the nearest county remaining vacant at the time.
Thus the head of the house of Clare must have taken Hertford
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
for his title, because Essex had already been given to Geoffrey,
while Suffolk was included in the earldom of Hugh, as "Earl
of the East Angles." So, too, Miles of Gloucester must have
selected Hereford, because Gloucester was already the title of
his lord. Aubrey de Vere, coming, as he did, among the later
of these creations, could not obtain Essex, in which lay his
chief seat, but sought for Cambridge, in which county he held
an extensive fief. But here, too, he had been forestalled. He
had, therefore, to go further afield, receiving his choice of the
counties of Oxford, Berks, Wilts, or Dorset. And of these he
chose the nearest, Oxford to wit. Here then we have, I think,
a definite principle at work, which has never, so far as I know,
been enunciated before.</p>

<p>It may have been observed that I assume throughout that
each earl is the earl of a county. It would not be possible here
to discuss this point in detail, so I will merely give it as my
own conviction that while comital rank was at this period
so far a personal dignity that men spoke of Earl Hugh, Earl
Gilbert, or Earl Geoffrey, yet that an earl without a county
was a conception that had not yet entered into the minds of
men.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_815" id="Ref_815" href="#Foot_815">[815]</a></span> In this, of course, we have a relic of the earl's <i>official</i>
character. To me, therefore, the struggles of antiquaries to
solve puzzles of their own creation as to the correct names
of earldoms are but waste of paper and ink, and occasionally,
even, of brain-power. "Earl William" might be spoken of
by that style only, or he might be further distinguished by
adding "of Arundel," "of Chichester," or "of Sussex." But
his earldom was not affected or altered by any such distinctive
addition to his style. A firm grasp of the broad principle
which I have set forth above should avoid any possibility of
trouble or doubt on the question.</p>

<p>But, keeping close to the "fiscal earls," let us now see
whether, as alleged, they were deposed by Henry II., and, if
so, to what extent.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Stubbs, "amongst the terms of pacification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span>
which were intended to bind both Stephen and Henry ...
the new earldoms [were] to be extinguished."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_816" id="Ref_816" href="#Foot_816">[816]</a></span> Consequently,
on his accession as king, "Henry was bound to annul the
titular creations of Stephen, and it was by no means certain
within what limits the promise would be construed."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_817" id="Ref_817" href="#Foot_817">[817]</a></span> But
I cannot find in any account of the said terms of pacification
any allusion whatever to the supposed "fiscal earls." Nor
indeed does Dr. Stubbs himself, in his careful analysis of these
terms,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_818" id="Ref_818" href="#Foot_818">[818]</a></span> include anything of the kind. The statement is therefore,
I presume, a retrospective induction.</p>

<p>The fact from which must have been inferred the existence
of the above promise is that "cashiering of the supposititious
earls" which rests, so far as I can see, on the statement of a
single chronicler.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_819" id="Ref_819" href="#Foot_819">[819]</a></span> Yet that statement, for what it is worth,
is sufficiently precise to warrant Dr. Stubbs in saying that "to
abolish the 'fiscal' earldoms" was among the first of Henry's
reforms.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_820" id="Ref_820" href="#Foot_820">[820]</a></span> The actual words of our great historian should, in
justice, be here quoted:—</p>

<td>"Another measure which must
have been taken at the coronation
[December 19, 1154], when all the recognized
earls did their homage and
paid their ceremonial services, seems
to have been the degrading or cashiering
of the supposititious earls created
by Stephen and Matilda. Some of
these may have obtained recognition
by getting new grants; but those
who lost endowment and dignity at
once, like William of Ypres, the
leader of the Flemish mercenaries,
could make no terms. They sank to
the rank from which they had been
so incautiously raised" (<i>Early Plantagenets</i>,
pp. 41, 42).</td>

<td>"We have no record of actual displacement;
some, at least, of the
fiscal earls retained their dignity:
the earldoms of Bedford, Somerset,
York, and perhaps a few others, drop
out of the list; those of Essex and
Wilts remain. Some had already
made their peace with the king;
some, like Aubrey de Vere, obtained
a new charter for their dignity: this
part of the social reconstruction was
despatched without much complaint
or difficulty" (<i>Const. Hist.</i>, i. 451).</td>

</tr>

</table>

<p>Before examining these statements, I must deal with the
assertion that William of Ypres was a fiscal earl who "lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
endowment and dignity at once." That he ever obtained an
English earldom I have already ventured to deny; that he lost
his "endowment" at Henry's accession I shall now proceed to
disprove. It is a further illustration of the danger attendant
on a blind following of the chroniclers that the expulsion of
the Flemings, and the fall of their leader, are events which are
always confidently assigned to the earliest days of Henry's
reign.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_821" id="Ref_821" href="#Foot_821">[821]</a></span> For though Stephen died in October, 1154, it can be
absolutely proved by record evidence that William of Ypres
continued to enjoy his rich "endowment" down to Easter,
1157.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_822" id="Ref_822" href="#Foot_822">[822]</a></span> Stephen had, indeed, provided well for his great and
faithful follower, quartering him on the county of Kent, where
he held ancient demesne of the Crown to the annual value of
£261 "blanch," <i>plus</i> £178 8<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> "numero" of Crown escheats
formerly belonging to the Bishop of Bayeux. Such a provision
was enormous for the time at which it was made.</p>

<p>Returning now to the "cashiering" of the earls, it will be
noticed that Dr. Stubbs has great difficulty in producing
instances in point, and can find nothing answering to any
general measure of the kind. But I am prepared to take firm
ground, and boldly to deny that a single man, who enjoyed
comital rank at the death of Stephen, can be shown to have
lost that rank under Henry II.</p>

<p>Rash though it may seem thus to impugn the conclusions
of Dr. Stubbs <i>in toto</i>, the facts are inexorably clear. Indeed,
the weakness of his position is manifest when he seeks evidence
for its support from a passage in the <i>Polycraticus</i>:—</p>

<p class="small">"The following passage of the <i>Polycraticus</i> probably refers to the
transient character of the new dignities, although some of the persons mentioned
in it were not of Stephen's promoting: "Ubi sunt, ut de domesticis
loquar, Gaufridus, Milo, Ranulfus, Alanus, Simon, Gillibertus, non tam
comites regni quam hostes publici? Ubi Willelmus Sarisberiensis?" (<i>Const.
Hist.</i>, i. 451 note).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span>
For this passage has nothing to do with "the transient
character of the new dignities": it alludes to a totally different
subject, the <i>death</i> of certain magnates, and is written in the
spirit of Henry of Huntingdon's <i>De Contemptu Mundi</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_823" id="Ref_823" href="#Foot_823">[823]</a></span> The
magnates referred to are Geoffrey, Earl of Essex (d. 1144);
Miles, Earl of Hereford (d. 1143); Randulf, Earl of Chester
(d. 1153); Count Alan of Richmond (d. 1146?); Simon, Earl
of Northampton (d. 1153); and Gilbert, Earl of Pembroke
(d. 1148).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_824" id="Ref_824" href="#Foot_824">[824]</a></span> Their names alone are sufficient to show that the
passage has been misunderstood, for no one could suggest that
the Earl of Chester or Earl Simon, Waltheof's heir, enjoyed
"new dignities," or that their earldoms proved of a "transient
character."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_825" id="Ref_825" href="#Foot_825">[825]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the three cases of actual displacement tentatively selected
by Dr. Stubbs, Bedford may be at once rejected; for Hugh de
Beaumont had lost the dignity (so far as he ever possessed it<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_826" id="Ref_826" href="#Foot_826">[826]</a></span>),
together with the fief itself, in 1141.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_827" id="Ref_827" href="#Foot_827">[827]</a></span> York requires separate
treatment: William of Aumâle sometimes, but rarely, styled himself,
under Stephen, Earl of York; he did not, however, under
Henry II., lose his comital rank,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_828" id="Ref_828" href="#Foot_828">[828]</a></span> and that is sufficient for my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
purpose. The earldom of Dorset (or Somerset) is again a
special case. Its existence is based—(1) on "Earl William de
Mohun" appearing as a witness in June, 1141; (2) on the
statement in the <i>Gesta</i> that he was made Earl of Dorset in
1141; (3) on his founding Bruton Priory, as "William de
Mohun, Earl of Somerset," in 1142. The terms of the charter
to Earl Aubrey may imply a doubt as to the <i>status</i> of this
earldom, even in 1142, but, in any case, it does not subsequently
occur, so far as is at present known, and there is
nothing to connect the disappearance of the title with the
accession of Henry II.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_829" id="Ref_829" href="#Foot_829">[829]</a></span></p>

<p>Such slight evidence as we have on the dealings of Henry
with the earls is opposed to the view that anything was done,
as suggested, "at the coronation" (December 19, 1154). It
was not, we have seen, till January, 1156, that charters were
granted dealing with the earldoms of Essex and of Oxford.
And it can only have been when some time had elapsed since
the coronation that Hugh Bigod obtained a charter creating
him anew Earl of Norfolk.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_830" id="Ref_830" href="#Foot_830">[830]</a></span></p>

<p>To sum up the result of this inquiry, we have now seen that
no such beings as "fiscal" earls ever existed. No chronicler
mentions the name, and their existence is based on nothing but
a false assumption. Stephen did not "incautiously" confer on
men in a state of "poverty" the dignity of earl; he did not
make provision for them by Exchequer pensions; no promise
was made, in the terms between Henry and himself, to degrade
or cashier any such earls; and no proof exists that any were
so cashiered when Henry came to the throne. Indeed, we may
go further and say that Stephen's earldoms all continued, and
that their alleged abolition, as a general measure, has been here
absolutely disproved.</p>

So also Gneist: "Under Stephen, new comites appear to be created

The error arises from a not unnatural, but mistaken, rendering of the
Latin. The term "fiscus" was used at the time in the sense of Crown
demesne. Thus Stephen claimed the treasures of Roger of Salisbury "quia
eas tempore regis Henrici, avunculi et antecessoris sui, <i>ex fisci regii redditibus</i>
Rogerius episcopus collegisset" (<i>Will. Malms.</i>). So, too, in the same reign,
the Earl of Chester is suspected of treason, "quia <i>regalium fiscorum redditus</i>
et castella, quæ violentur possederat reddere negligebat" (<i>Gesta</i>). This
latter passage has been misunderstood, Miss Norgate, for instance, rendering
it: "to pay his dues to the royal treasury." It means that the earl
refused to surrender the Crown castles and estates which he had seized.
Again, speaking of the accession of Henry of Essex's fief to the Crown
demesne, William of Newburgh writes: "amplissimo autem patrimonio ejus
<i>fiscum</i> auxit."</p>

The erroneous view is also found in a valuable essay on "The Crown
Lands," by Mr. S. R. Bird, who writes: "It is true that extensive alienations
of those lands [the demesne lands of the Crown] took place during the turbulent
reign of Stephen, in order to enable that monarch to endow the new
earldoms" (<i>Antiquary</i>, xiii. 160).</p>

Buckingham is a most difficult and obscure title, and is only inserted

This view is not affected by the fact that two or even more counties (as
in the case of Waltheof's earldom) might be, officially, linked together, for
where this arrangement had lingered on, the group might (or might not) be
treated as one county, as regarded the earl. Warwick and Leicester are

writes Gervase (i. 161), "Guillelmus de Ypre et omnes fere Flandrenses qui

"William of Salisbury" was a deceased magnate, but is mentioned
by himself in the above passage because he was not an earl. As he is overlooked
by genealogists, it may be well to explain who he was. He fought
for the Empress at the siege of Winchester, where he was taken prisoner by
the Earl of Hertford (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, ed. Stubbs, ii. 587). He was also the
"Willelmus ... civitatis Saresbiriæ præceptor ... et municeps" (<i>Gesta</i>,
ed. Howlett, p. 96), who took part in the attack on Wilton nunnery in 1143,
and "lento tandem cruciatu tortus interiit." This brings us to a document
in the register of St. Osmund (i. 237), in which "Walterus, Edwardi vicecomitis
filius, et Sibilla uxor mea et heres noster Comes Patricius" make
a grant to the church of Salisbury "nominatim pro anima Willelmi filii
nostri fratris comitis Patricii in restauramentum dampnorum quæ prænominatus
filius noster Willelmus Sarum ecclesie fecerit." The paternity of William
is thus established.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_826" id="Foot_826" href="#Ref_826">[826]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I have never found him attesting any charter as an earl, though this

Aumâle ("Albemarle") is notoriously a difficult title, as one of those
of which the bearer enjoyed comital rank, though whether as a Norman
count or as an English earl, it is, at first, difficult to decide. Eventually, of
course, the dignity became an English earldom.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_829" id="Foot_829" href="#Ref_829">[829]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_830" id="Foot_830" href="#Ref_830">[830]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was granted at Northampton. Its date is of importance as proving
that the charter to the Earl of Arundel, being attested by Hugh as earl,
must be of later date. Mr. Eyton, however, oddly enough, reverses the order
of the two (<i>Itinerary of Henry II.</i>, pp. 2, 3). He was thus misled by an
error in the witnesses to the Earl of Arundel's charter, which Foss had
acutely detected and explained long before.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX E.<br />
<small>THE ARRIVAL OF THE EMPRESS.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_55">55</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
true date of this event is involved in considerable obscurity.
The two most detailed versions are those of William of Malmesbury
and of the Continuator of Florence of Worcester. The
former states precisely that the Ecclesiastical Council lasted
from August 29 to September 1 (1139), and that the Empress
landed, at Arundel, on September 30; the latter gives no date
for the council, but asserts that the Empress landed, at Portsmouth,
before August 1—that is, two months earlier. These
grave discrepancies have been carefully discussed by Mr. Howlett,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_831" id="Ref_831" href="#Foot_831">[831]</a></span>
though he fails to note that the Continuator is thoroughly
consistent in his narrative, for he subsequently makes the
Empress remove from Bristol, after spending "more than two
months" there, to Gloucester in the middle of October. He
is, however, almost certainly wrong in placing the landing at
Portsmouth,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_832" id="Ref_832" href="#Foot_832">[832]</a></span> and no less mistaken in placing it so early in the
year. The "in autumno" of Ordericus clearly favours William
rather than the Continuator.</p>

<p>Mr. Howlett, in his detailed investigation of this "exceedingly
complex chronological difficulty," endeavours to exalt the
value of the <i>Gesta</i> by laying peculiar stress on its mention
of Baldwin de Bedvers' landing, as suggestive of a fresh conjecture.
Urging that "Baldwin's was in very truth the main
army of invasion," he advances the</p>

<p class="nodent small">"theory that the expedition came in two sections, for the <i>Gesta Stephani</i>
say that Baldwin de Bedvers arrived 'forti militum catervâ,' as no doubt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
he did, for it was only his presence in force that could render the coming of
Maud and her brother with twenty or thirty retainers anything else than
an act of madness."</p>

<p>Here we see the danger of catching at a phrase. For if
the <i>Gesta</i> says that Baldwin landed "forti militum catervâ"
(p. 53), it also asserts that the Empress came "cum robustâ
militum manu" (p. 55)—a phrase which Mr. Howlett ignores—while
it speaks of her son, in later years, arriving "cum florida
militum catervâ," when, according to Mr. Howlett, "his following
was small" (p. xvii.), and when, indeed, the <i>Gesta</i> itself
(p. 129) explains that this "florida militum catervâ" was in
truth "militum globum exiguum." But this is not all. Mr.
Howlett speaks, we have seen, of "twenty or thirty retainers,"
and asserts that "Malmesbury and Robert of Torigny agree
that he [Earl Robert] had but a handful of men—twenty, or
even twelve as the former has it" (p. xxiv.). It is difficult to
see how he came to do so, for William of Malmesbury distinctly
states that he brought with him, not twelve, but a hundred
and forty knights,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_833" id="Ref_833" href="#Foot_833">[833]</a></span> and, in his recapitulation of the earl's
conduct, repeats the same number. Now, if the <i>Gesta</i> admits
that the little band of knights who accompanied, in later
years, the young Henry to England, was swollen by rumour
to many thousands,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_834" id="Ref_834" href="#Foot_834">[834]</a></span> surely it is easy to understand how the
hundred and forty knights, who accompanied the earl to
England, were swollen by rumour (when it reached the Continuator
of Florence of Worcester) to a "grandis exercitus,"—without
resorting to Mr. Howlett's far-fetched explanation
that the Continuator confused the two landings and imagined
that the Empress had arrived with Baldwin, who "landed at
Wareham ... about August 1." But if he was so ill informed,
what is the value of his evidence? And indeed, his statement
that she landed "at Portsmouth" (not, be it observed, at Wareham,
nor with Baldwin) places him out of court, for it is
accepted by no one. Mr. Howlett offers the desperate explanation,
which he terms "no strained conjecture," that "Earl
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
Robert went on by sea to Portsmouth," a guess for which there
is no basis or, indeed, probability, and which, even if admitted,
would be no explanation; for the Continuator takes the Empress
and her brother to Portsmouth first and to Arundel afterwards.</p>

<p>The real point to strike one in the matter is that the
Empress should have landed in Sussex when her friends were
awaiting her in the west—for Mr. Howlett fails to realize that
she trusted to them and not to an "army" of her own.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_835" id="Ref_835" href="#Foot_835">[835]</a></span> The
most probable explanation, doubtless, is that she hoped to
evade Stephen, while he was carefully guarding the roads
leading from the south-western coast to Gloucester and Bristol.
Robert of Torigny distinctly implies that Stephen had effectually
closed the other ports ("Appulerunt itaque apud Harundel,
quia tunc alium portum non habebant").</p>

<p>In any case Mr. Howlett's endeavour to harmonize the two
conflicting dates—the end of July and the end of September—by
suggesting as a compromise the end of August, cannot be
pronounced a success.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_836" id="Ref_836" href="#Foot_836">[836]</a></span></p>

<p>It may afford, perhaps, some fresh light if we trace the
king's movements after the arrival of the Empress.</p>

<p>Though the narratives of the chroniclers for the period
between the landing of the Empress and the close of 1139 are
at first sight difficult to reconcile, and, in any case, hard to
understand, it is possible to unravel the sequence of events
by a careful collation of their respective versions, aided by
study of the topography and of other relative considerations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span></p>

<p>On the landing of the Empress, the Earl of Gloucester,
leaving her at Arundel, proceeded to Bristol (<i>Will. Malms.</i>,
p. 725). Stephen, who, says Florence's Continuator (p. 117),
was then besieging Marlborough, endeavoured to intercept him
(<i>Gesta</i>, p. 56), but, failing in this, returned to besiege the
Empress at Arundel (<i>ibid.</i>; <i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>, p. 117; <i>Gervase</i>, i.
110). Desisting, however, from this siege, he allowed her to
set out for Bristol.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_837" id="Ref_837" href="#Foot_837">[837]</a></span> Meanwhile, her brother, on his way to
Bristol, had held a meeting with Brian fitz Count (<i>Will.
Malms.</i>, p. 725), and had evidently arranged with him a concerted
plan of action (it must be remembered that they intended
immediate revolt, for they had promised the Empress possession
of her realm within a few months<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_838" id="Ref_838" href="#Foot_838">[838]</a></span>). Brian had, accordingly,
returned to Wallingford, and declared at once for the Empress
(<i>Gesta</i>, p. 58). Stephen now marched against him, but either
by the advice of his followers (<i>ibid.</i>) or from impatience at the
tedium of the siege,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_839" id="Ref_839" href="#Foot_839">[839]</a></span> again abandoned his undertaking, and
leaving a detachment to blockade Brian (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>, p. 118),
marched west, himself, to strike at the centre of the revolt. He
first attacked and captured Cerney (near Cirencester), a small
fortress of Miles of Gloucester (<i>Gesta</i>, p. 59; <i>Will. Malms.</i>,
p. 726), and was then called south to Malmesbury by the news
that Robert fitz Hubert had surprised it (on the 7th of October)
and expelled his garrison (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, p. 726; <i>Cont. Flor.
Wig.</i>, p. 119; <i>Gesta</i>, p. 59). Recovering the castle, within a
fortnight of its capture (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, p. 726), after besieging
it eight days (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>, p. 125), he was then decoyed
still further south by the news that Humphrey de Bohun, at the
instigation of Miles, had garrisoned Trowbridge against him.
Here, however, he was not so fortunate (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, p. 726;
<i>Gesta</i>, p. 59). In the meanwhile Miles of Gloucester, with the
instinct of a born warrior, had seized the opportunity thus
afforded him, and, striking out boldly from his stronghold at
Gloucester, marched to the relief of Brian fitz Count. Bursting
by night on the blockading force, he scattered them in all
directions, and returned in triumph to Gloucester (<i>Gesta</i>, p. 60).
It was probably the tidings of this disaster (though the fact is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
not so stated) that induced Stephen to abandon his unsuccessful
siege of Trowbridge, and retrace his steps to the Thames
valley (<i>ibid.</i>, pp. 61, 62). This must have been early in
November.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_840" id="Ref_840" href="#Foot_840">[840]</a></span></p>

<p>Seizing his chance, the active Miles again sallied forth from
Gloucester, but this time toward the north, and, on the 7th of
November, sacked and burnt Worcester (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>, pp. 118-120).
About the same time he made himself master of Hereford
and its county for the Empress (<i>Will. Malms.</i>, p. 727; <i>Gesta</i>,
p. 61). Stephen was probably in the Thames valley when he
received news of this fresh disaster, which led him once more
to march west. Advancing from Oxford, he entered Worcester,
and beheld the traces of the enemy's attack (<i>Cont. Flor. Wig.</i>,
p. 121). After a stay there of a few days, he heard that the
enemy had seized Hereford and were besieging his garrison in
the castle (<i>ibid.</i>).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_841" id="Ref_841" href="#Foot_841">[841]</a></span> He therefore advanced to Leominster by
way of Little Hereford,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_842" id="Ref_842" href="#Foot_842">[842]</a></span> but Advent Sunday (December 3)
having brought about a cessation of hostilities, he retraced his
steps to Worcester (<i>ibid.</i>). Thence, after another brief stay,
he marched back to Oxford, probably making for Wallingford
and London. Evidently, however, on reaching Oxford, he
received news of the death of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_843" id="Ref_843" href="#Foot_843">[843]</a></span> It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
was probably this which led him to keep his Christmas at
Salisbury. Thither, therefore, he proceeded from Oxford, returning
at the close of the year to Reading (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

<p>The question, then, it will be seen, is this. Assuming, as
we must do, that William of Malmesbury is right in the date
he assigns to Stephen's visit to Malmesbury and recovery of
Malmesbury Castle, is it consistent with the date he assigns to
the landing of the Empress and her brother? That is to say,
is it possible that the events which, we have seen, must have
occurred between the above landing and Stephen's visit to
Malmesbury can have been all comprised within the space of a
fortnight? This is a matter of opinion on which I do not
pronounce.</p>

bellum aggredi temptaret ... in sancti spiritus et dominæ sanctæ Mariæ

Mr. Freeman (<i>Norm. Conq.</i>, v. 291) takes the place of landing (Portsmouth)
from the one account, and the date (September 30) from the other,
without saying so. I notice this because it is characteristic. Thus Mr. James
Parker (<i>Early History of Oxford</i>, p. 191) observes of Mr. Freeman's account
of the Conqueror's advance on London: "Though by leaving out here and
there the discrepancies, the residue may be worked up into a consecutive and
consistent series of events, such a process amounts to making history, not
writing it. Amidst a mass of contradictory evidence it is impossible to arrive
at any sure conclusion.... It is, however, comparatively easy to piece
together such details as will fit out of the various stories; and more easy
still to discover reasons for the results which such mosaic work produces."</p>

It is an instance of the extraordinary confusion, at this point, in the

London, and thence to Ely, omitting all the intervening events, which will

"Fama volante regiæ majestati nunciatur inimicos suos, juratæ quidem
pacis violatores Herefordiam invasisse, monasterium S. Æthelberti regis et
martyris, velut in castellinum munimen penetrasse." It seems absolutely
certain, especially if we add the testimony of the other MSS., that this passage
refers to the attack on the royal garrison in the castle so graphically
described by the author of the <i>Gesta</i>, but (apparently) placed by him among
the events of the summer of the following year. As, however, his narrative
breaks off just at this point, his sequence of events is left uncertain, and in
any case the chronology of the local chronicler, who here writes as an eyewitness,
must be preferred to his.</p>

This passage (p. 121) should be compared with that on pp. 123, 124
("Rex et comes ... Oxenefordiam"), which looks extremely like a repetition
of it (as the passage on pp. 110, 111 is an anticipation of that on pp. 116,
117).</p>

favour of the former of the two dates.</p>

<small>THE DEFECTION OF MILES OF GLOUCESTER.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_55">55</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Miss Norgate</span>
assigns this event to the early summer of the
year 1138,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_844" id="Ref_844" href="#Foot_844">[844]</a></span> on the authority of Gervase of Canterbury (i. 104).
The statement of that writer is clear enough, but it is also
clear that he made it on the authority of the Continuator of
Florence. Now, the Continuator muddled in inextricable confusion
the events of 1138 and 1139. In this he was duly followed
by Gervase, who gives us, under 1138, first the arrest of
the bishops at Oxford (June, 1139), then the <i>diffidatio</i> of the
Earl of Gloucester, next the revolt of 1138 and the defection
of Miles, next the invitation to the Empress (1139), followed by
the Battle of the Standard (1138), and lastly the death of the
Bishop of Salisbury (December, 1139). This can be clearly
traced to the Continuator,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_845" id="Ref_845" href="#Foot_845">[845]</a></span> and conclusive evidence, if required,
is afforded by the fact that Gervase, like the Continuator,
travels again over the same ground under 1139. Thus the
defection of Miles is told twice over, as will be seen from these
parallel extracts:—</p>

<p>It is obvious from these extracts that the Continuator tells
the tale of the constable's <i>diffidatio</i> and defection twice over;
it is further obvious, from his own evidence, that the second of
the two dates (1139) is the right one, for he tells us that so
late as February, 1139, Stephen gave Gloucester Abbey to
Gilbert Foliot "petente constabulario suo Milone."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_846" id="Ref_846" href="#Foot_846">[846]</a></span> When
we find that this event is assigned by the author of the <i>Gesta</i>
to 1139, that the constableship of Miles was not transferred to
William de Beauchamp till the latter part of 1139, and that
Miles is not mentioned among the rebels in 1138 (though his
importance would preclude his omission), nor is any attack on
Gloucester assigned to Stephen in that year, we may safely
decide that the defection of Miles did not take place till the
arrival of the Empress in 1139.</p>

<p>Since writing the above I have noted the presence of Miles
of Gloucester among the followers of Stephen at the siege of
Shrewsbury (August, 1138).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_847" id="Ref_847" href="#Foot_847">[847]</a></span> This is absolutely conclusive,
proving as it does that Miles was still on the king's side in the
revolt of 1138.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX H.<br />
<small>THE "TERTIUS DENARIUS."</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_97">97</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Special</span>
research has led me to discover that all our historians
are in error in their accounts of this institution.</p>

<p>The key to the enquiry will be found in the fact that the
term "tertius denarius" had two distinct denotations; that is
to say, was used in two different senses. Dr. Stubbs and Mr.
Freeman have both failed to grasp this essential fact. The two
varieties of the "tertius denarius" were these:—</p>

<p>(1) The "tertius denarius placitorum comitatus." This
is the recognized "third penny" of which historians speak.
Observe that this was not, as it is sometimes loosely termed,
and as, indeed, Gneist describes it, "the customary third of
the revenues of the county,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_848" id="Ref_848" href="#Foot_848">[848]</a></span> but, as Dr. Stubbs accurately
terms it, "the third penny of the pleas."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_849" id="Ref_849" href="#Foot_849">[849]</a></span> So here the Empress
grants to Geoffrey de Mandeville "tertium denarium vicecomitatus
<i>de placitis</i>" (cf. p. 239). This distinction is all-important,
for "the pleas" only represented a small portion of
the total "revenues of the county" as compounded for in the
sheriff's <i>firma</i>.</p>

<p>(2) The "tertius denarius redditus burgi." This "third
penny," which has been strangely confused with the other,
differs from it in these two respects. Firstly, it is that, not of
the pleas ("placitorum"), but of the total revenues ("redditus");
secondly, it is that, not of the county ("comitatus"),
but of a town alone ("burgi").</p>

<p>This distinction, which is absolutely certain from Domesday
and from record evidence, is fortunately shown, with singular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
clearness, in the charter of the Empress to Miles of Gloucester,
creating him Earl of Hereford. In it she grants—</p>

<p class="small">"Tertium denarium redditus burgi Hereford quicquid unquam reddat,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_850" id="Ref_850" href="#Foot_850">[850]</a></span>
et tertium denarium placitorum totius comitatus Hereford."</p>

<p>Nor is it less clear in the charter (1155), by which Henry II.
creates Hugh Bigod Earl of Norfolk "scilicet de tercio denario
de Norwic et de Norfolca."</p>

<p>Now, let us trace how the "tertius denarius redditus burgi"
has been erroneously taken for the "tertius denarius placitorum
totius comitatus," the only recognized "third penny."</p>

<p>Dr. Stubbs writes: "The third penny of the county which
had been a part of the profits of the English earls is occasionally
referred to in Domesday."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_851" id="Ref_851" href="#Foot_851">[851]</a></span> The passage on which this statement
is based is found earlier in the volume. Our great
historian there writes:—</p>

<p class="small">"Each shire was under an ealdorman, who sat with the sheriff and
bishop in the folkmoot, and received a third part of the profits of jurisdiction.
(The third penny of the county appears from Domesday [i. 1. 26, 203, 246,
252, 280, 298, 336] to have been paid to the earl in the time of Edward the
Confessor.—Ellis, <i>Introduction to Domesday</i>, i. 167)."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_852" id="Ref_852" href="#Foot_852">[852]</a></span></p>

<p>The argument that the ealdorman, or earl, of the days before
the Conquest, received "a third part of the profits of jurisdiction"
in the county, rests here, it will be seen, wholly on
the evidence of Domesday. But in six of the eight passages
on which Dr. Stubbs relies we are distinctly dealing, not with
the county ("comitatus"), but with a single town ("burgus").
These are Dover, Lewes, Huntingdon, Stafford, Shrewsbury,
and Lincoln. In these, therefore, the third penny could only
be that of the <i>redditus burgi</i>, not of the <i>placita comitatus</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_853" id="Ref_853" href="#Foot_853">[853]</a></span>
Huntingdon is specially a case in point, for there the earl
received a third of each of the items out of which the render
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
("redditus") of the town was composed. The only cases of
those mentioned which could possibly concern the third penny
"placitorum comitatus" are those of Yorkshire (298), Lincolnshire
(336), and Nottinghamshire with Derbyshire (280).
Even in these, however, "the third penny of the pleas" is only
vaguely implied, the passages referring to a peculiar system
which has, I believe, never obtained the attentive study it
deserves. This system was confined to the Danish district, to
which these counties all belonged.</p>

<p>The main point, however, which we have to keep in view
is that "the third penny" of the <i>revenues</i> of the <i>town</i> has
nothing to do with "the third penny" of the <i>pleas</i> of the
<i>county</i>, and that the passages in Domesday concerning the
former must not be quoted as evidence for the latter. I do not
find that Ellis (<i>Introduction</i>, i. 167, 168) is responsible for so
taking them, but Dr. Stubbs, as we have seen, clearly confused
the two kinds of <i>tertius denarius</i>, and we find that Mr. Freeman
does the same when he tells us that at Exeter "six pounds—that
is, the earl's third penny—went to the Sheriff Baldwin."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_854" id="Ref_854" href="#Foot_854">[854]</a></span></p>

<p>We are reminded by this last instance that not only the
earl, but the sheriff, was concerned with "the third penny" of
the <i>revenues</i> of the <i>town</i>. This—which (I would here again
repeat) is not the earl's "third penny" to which historians
allude—sometimes, as for instance at Shrewsbury and Exeter,
fell to the sheriff's share. Dr. Stubbs mentions the case of
Shrewsbury only, and takes it as evidence that "the sheriff
as well as the ealdorman was entitled to a share of the profits
of administration."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_855" id="Ref_855" href="#Foot_855">[855]</a></span></p>

<p>This third penny "redditus burgi" is in Domesday absolutely
erratic. In the Wiltshire and Somersetshire towns, it seems
to have been held by the king himself, though at Cricklade
both he and Westminster Abbey are credited with it (64 <i>b</i>, 67).
At Leicester it was held by Hugh de Grantmesnil, but we are
not told by what right (i. 230). At Stafford it had been held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
by the English earl, and had fallen with his estates to the
Crown. The Conqueror kept it, but, halving his own two-thirds
share, made a fresh "third," which he granted to Robert de
Stafford.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_856" id="Ref_856" href="#Foot_856">[856]</a></span> At Ipswich it had, with the "tertius denarius [<i>i.e.</i>
placitorum] de duobus hundret," been annexed to an estate
held by the local earl. The whole of this was granted by the
Conqueror to his follower, Earl Alan.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_857" id="Ref_857" href="#Foot_857">[857]</a></span> At Worcester, by a
curious arrangement, the total render had been divided, in unequal
portions, between the king and the earl, while a third of
the whole was received by the bishop. At Fordwich "the
third penny" fell to Bishop Odo, and was bestowed by him, with
the king's consent, on St. Augustine's, Canterbury, to which
the other two-thirds had been given already by the Confessor.
The case of Bristol has led Mr. Freeman into a characteristic
error. We read in Domesday:—</p>

<p class="small">"Burgenses dicunt quod episcopus G. habet xxxiii marcas argenti et
unam marcam auri p[re]ter firmam regis" (i. 163).</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman, who is never weary of insisting on the value of
Domesday, is clearly not so familiar as one could wish with its
normal contractions, for he renders the closing words "p<i>rop</i>ter
firmam regis." On this he observes: "This looks like the earl's
third penny; but Geoffrey certainly had no formal earldom in
Gloucestershire."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_858" id="Ref_858" href="#Foot_858">[858]</a></span> When we substitute for the meaningless
"propter" the right reading "preter" ("in addition to"), we
see at once that the figures given no longer suggest a "third
penny."</p>

<p>Leaving now the third penny of the revenues of the country
town, let us turn our attention to that of the pleas of the whole
county. Independent of the system in the Danelaw to which
I have referred above, we have two references in Domesday to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
this "third penny." Firstly, the "tercius denarius de totâ
scirâ Dorsete" (i. 75); secondly (in the case of Warwickshire)
"tercio denario placitorum siræ" (i. 278), yet neither of these is
among the cases appealed to by Dr. Stubbs. Now, the curious
point about them is that in neither instance was the right
annexed to the dignity of earl, but to a certain manor, which
manor was held by the earl. That is to say, he was entitled to this
"third penny of the pleas" not <i>quâ</i> earl, but <i>quâ</i> lord of that
estate. The distinction is vital. Whether "the third penny
of the pleas" be that of the whole shire or only of a single
hundred, it is always attached, under the Confessor, to the
possession of some manor. We find the "tercius denarius" of
one, of two, of three, of even six hundreds so annexed.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_859" id="Ref_859" href="#Foot_859">[859]</a></span> This
peculiarity would seem to have been an essential feature of the
system, and I need scarcely point out how opposed it is to the
alleged tenure <i>ex officio</i> in days before the Conquest, or to that
granted to the earl <i>quâ</i> earl under the Norman and Angevin
kings. Let us seek to learn when the latter institution, the
recognized "tertius denarius," became first annexed to the
dignity of earl.</p>

<p>The prevailing view would seem to be that it was so annexed
from the first; that its possession, in fact, was part of, or rather
was connoted by, the dignity of an earl. Madox held that the
oldest mode of conferring the dignity of earl, a mode "coeval
to the Norman Conquest," was by charter; and he further
held that "By the charter the king granted to the earl the
<i>tertius denarius comitatus</i>."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_860" id="Ref_860" href="#Foot_860">[860]</a></span> Dr. Stubbs writes, of the investiture
of earls in the Norman period:—</p>

<p class="small">"The idea of official position is not lost sight of, although the third penny
of the pleas and the sword of the shire alone attest its original character"
(<i>Const. Hist.</i>, i. 363).</p>

<p>Mr. Freeman puts the case thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Earldoms are now in their transitional stage. They have become
hereditary; but they carry with them the official perquisite of the ancient
official earls, the third penny of the king's revenues in the shire."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_861" id="Ref_861" href="#Foot_861">[861]</a></span></p>

<p>Here it may at once be pointed out that the mistake which I
referred to at the outset is again made, "the third penny" being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
described as that not of the pleas, but "of the revenues" of the
county. Then there is the question whether this perquisite
was indeed the right of "the ancient official earls." Lastly, we
must ask whether the earldoms granted in this period did unquestionably
"carry with them" this "official perquisite."</p>

<p>To answer this last question, we must turn to our record
evidence. Now, the very first charter quoted by Madox himself,
in support of his own view, is the creation by Stephen of
the earldom of Essex in favour of Geoffrey de Mandeville. The
formula there is quite vague. Geoffrey is to hold "bene et in
pace et libere et quiete et honorifice sicut alii Comites mei de
terrâ meâ melius vel honorificentius tenent Comitatus suos
unde Comites sunt." Here there is nothing about the "third
penny," and we must therefore ask whether its grant is included
in the above formula; that is to say, whether an earl
received his "third penny" as a mere matter of course. The
contrary is, it would seem, implied by the special way in which
the "third penny" is granted him in the charter of the Empress,
together with the curious added phrase, "sicut comes habere
debet in comitatu suo." This phrase may, of course, be held
to imply that an earl had, as earl, a recognized right to the sum,
but the fact that in the other charters of the Empress (those of
the earldoms of Hereford and Oxford) the "tertius denarius"
is made the subject of a special grant, and that in her son's
charters it is the same, would suggest that, without such special
grant, the right was not conveyed. This is the view taken by
Gneist (who founds, in the main, on Madox):—</p>

<p class="small">"It is only a <i>donatio sub modo</i>, the grant of a permanent income 'for
the better support of the dignity of an earl;' it consists in a mere order or
precept addressed to the sheriff, and is therefore a right of demand, but no
feudal right, and is accompanied by no investiture."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_862" id="Ref_862" href="#Foot_862">[862]</a></span></p>

<p>That the grant of "the third penny" (of the pleas of the
county) was not an innovation introduced in this reign, is
proved by the solitary surviving Pipe-Roll of Henry I., in
which, however, there is but one mention of this "third penny,"
namely, in the case of the Earl of Gloucester. Indeed, with
the exception of this entry, and of the special arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
which existed before the Conquest in the Danish districts (<i>ut
supra</i>), it may be said that the charters of the Empress, in 1141,
represent the first occurrence of this "third penny."</p>

<p>Again, if we turn to the succeeding reign, we find, though
the fact appears to have hitherto escaped notice, that, as far
as the printed Pipe-Rolls take us—that is, for the first few years—less
than half the existing earls were in receipt of the "third
penny." Careful examination of the Rolls of 2-7 Hen. II.
reveals this fact. The earls to whom was paid "the third
penny of the pleas" were these: Essex, Hertford, Norfolk,
Gloucester, Wiltshire (Salisbury), Devon, and Sussex. Those
who are not entered in the Rolls, and who, therefore, it would
seem, cannot have received it, are Warwick, Leicester, Huntingdon,
Northampton, Derby (Ferrers), Oxford, Surrey, Chester,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_863" id="Ref_863" href="#Foot_863">[863]</a></span>
Lincoln, and Cornwall. Thus seven received this sum, and ten
did not. The inference, of course, from this discovery is that
the possession of the dignity of an earl did not <i>per se</i> carry with
it "the third penny of the pleas," the right to which could
only be conferred by a special grant.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_864" id="Ref_864" href="#Foot_864">[864]</a></span> This, apparently conclusive,
evidence illustrates and confirms the words of the
<i>Dialogus</i>:—</p>

<p class="small">"Comes autem est qui tertiam portionem eorum quæ de placitis proveniunt
in quolibet comitatu percipit. Summa namque illa quæ nomine firmæ requiritur

<p class="small">D. "Nunquid ex singulis comitatibus comites ista percipiunt."</p>

name="Ref_865" id="Ref_865" href="#Foot_865">[865]</a></span></p>

<p>This passage requires to be read as a whole, for the answer
might easily be differently understood, as indeed it has been
in the Lords' Reports,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_866" id="Ref_866" href="#Foot_866">[866]</a></span> where it is taken to apply to the earls
as well as to "the third penny." The point is of no small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
importance, for the conclusion drawn is that "both [the
dignity and the third penny] were either hereditary or personal,
at the pleasure of the Crown." Careful reading, however,
will show, I think, that, like the question, the reply deals with
"the third penny" alone. The "hæc conferenda decernit" of
the latter refers to the "ista" of the former.</p>

<p>Confirmed as they are by the evidence of the Pipe-Rolls,
the words of the <i>Dialogus</i> clearly prove that the view I take
is right, and that Professor Freeman is certainly wrong in
stating that "earldoms," at this stage, "carry with them the
third penny."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_867" id="Ref_867" href="#Foot_867">[867]</a></span> Mr. Hunt, who, here as elsewhere, seems to
follow Dr. Stubbs, writes that:—</p>

<p class="small">
"The earl still received the third penny of all profits of jurisdiction in
his county. With this exception, however, the policy of the Norman kings
stripped the earls of their official character."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_868" id="Ref_868" href="#Foot_868">[868]</a></span></p>

<p>This view must now be abandoned, and the total absence
of any allusion, in Stephen's creation of the earldom of Essex,
to "the third penny of the pleas," must be taken to imply that
the charter in question did not convey a right to that sum.
Thus the charter of the Empress to Geoffrey in 1141 remains
the first record in which that perquisite is granted.</p>

<p>We should also note that the <i>Dialogus</i> passage establishes
the fact that the only recognized "third penny" of the earl
was "the third penny of the pleas," and that the third penny
"redditus burgi," which, we saw, had been taken for it, is not
alluded to at all.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject it may be well to record the

<p>These figures are sufficient to disprove the view that the
third penny actually formed an endowment for the dignity of
an earl, but their chief interest is found in the light they throw
on the farming of the "pleas," illustrating, as they do, the
statement in the <i>Dialogus</i> that the sheriff's <i>firma</i> "ex magna
parte de placitis provenit." For multiplying these sums by
three we obtain the total for which the pleas were farmed in
their respective shires. It will be observed that "the third
penny" is stereotyped in amount, but an important passage
bearing upon this point is quoted by Madox (<i>Baronia Anglica</i>,
p. 139) from the Roll of 27 Hen. II.:—</p>

<p class="small">"Idem Vicecomes redd. comp. de £xxviii de tercio denario Comitatus
de Legercestria de vii annis præteritis, quos Comes Leg. accipere noluit, nisi
haberet similiter de cremento, sicut prædecessores sui recipere consueverunt
tempore Regis Henrici" (<i>sic</i>).</p>

<p>The meaning of this entry is that the earl demanded the
"third penny," not only of the old composition for the "pleas,"
but also of the increased sum now paid for them. The passage,
of course, is puzzling in its statement that the earl's predecessors
had received "the third penny," for, so far as the
printed Rolls take us, they never did so. A similar difficulty
is caused, in the case of Oxfordshire, by the charter of Henry
II. (see p. 239) granting to Aubrey de Vere its "third penny"
"ut sit inde Comes;" for there is no trace in the printed Rolls
of such payment being made, and in 7 John the then earl
actually owes "cc marcas pro habendo tercio denario Comitatus
Oxoniæ de placitis, et ut sit Comes Oxoniæ."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_870" id="Ref_870" href="#Foot_870">[870]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing from these perplexing cases, on which we need
fuller knowledge, we have a simple example in 12 Hen. III.,
when, on the death of the Earl of Essex (February 15, 1228), his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
annual third penny, as £40 10<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>, was allowed to count, for
his heirs, towards the payment of his debts to the Crown.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_871" id="Ref_871" href="#Foot_871">[871]</a></span> A
much later and most important instance is that of Devon,
where Hugh de Courtenay, as the heir of the Earls of Devon,
is found receiving their "third penny" in 8 Edw. III., though
not an earl, a state of things which provoked a protest, a
decision against him, and, eventually, his elevation to comital
rank.</p>

This passage appears to imply that Dr. Stubbs, who sees in the "third

borough as the perquisite of the sheriff. But the latter, as we have seen,
was held, as a rule, by the earl, though occasionally by the sheriff.</p>

Gneist is right in insisting on the fact that an earl was only entitled
to the "tertius denarius" in virtue of a distinct grant, but he fails to grasp
the important point that such grant was not made to every earl as a matter
of course, but only as a special favour. He is also, as we have seen, quite
mistaken as to the extent of the third penny (see p. 287).</p>

two, but this does not affect the general result.</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Dr. Stubbs</span>
writes: "A measure dictated still more distinctly
by this policy may be traced in the list of sheriffs for <small>A.D.</small> 1130.
Richard Basset and Aubrey de Vere, a judge and a royal
chamberlain, act as joint sheriffs in no less than eleven
counties; Geoffrey de Clinton, Miles of Gloucester, William
of Pont l'Arche, the treasurer, are also sheriffs as well as
justices of the king's court" (i. 892). But this statement
requires a certain qualification. For though they appear as
sheriffs (<i>vicecomites</i>) on the Roll, and have been always so
reckoned, we gather from one passage in the record that they
were, strictly speaking, not <i>vicecomites</i>, but <i>custodes</i>. The
difference is this. By the former a county was held <i>ad firmam</i>;
by the latter it was held <i>in custodia</i>. In the Inquest of Sheriffs
(1170) the distinction is clearly recognized. We there find
the expressions used: "sive eos tenuerint ad firmam, sive in
custodia." By the true sheriff (<i>vicecomes</i>) the county was,
in fact, leased. He, as its farmer (<i>firmarius</i>), was responsible
for its annual rent (<i>firma</i>). It was thus, virtually, a speculation
of his own, and the profit, if any, was his. But by a
process exactly analogous to that of a modern landlord taking
an estate into his own hands, and farming it himself through
a bailiff, the king could, under special circumstances, take a
county into his own hands, and farm it himself through
a bailiff (<i>custos</i>). Henry II., in his twentieth year, did this
with London, putting in his own <i>custodes</i> in the place of the
regular sheriffs, and, in later days, Henry III. and Edward I.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
did the same. It was this, I contend, that Henry I. had done
with the counties in question. The proof of it is found in
this passage:—</p>

<p class="small">"Ricardus basset et Albericus de Ver reddunt Compotum de M marcis
argenti de superplus Comitatuum, quas habent <i>in custodia</i>" (p. 63).</p>

<p>Here we have the very same phrase as that in the Inquest of
Sheriffs, while the enormous "superplus" of a thousand marcs
must represent the excess of receipts over the amount required
for the <i>firmæ</i>, which excess, the counties being "in custodia,"
fell to the share of the Crown. Thus we obtain the right
explanation of the employment in this capacity of royal officers,
and we further get a glimpse, which we would not lose, of one
of those administrative changes which, as under Henry II., tell
of a system of government as yet empirical and imperfect.</p>

<p>It is clear that this measure was no mere development, but
a sudden and unforeseen step. For in the case of Essex, the
scene of our story, William de Eynsford ("Æinesford"), a
Kentish landowner, had leased the county for five years, from
Michaelmas, 1128, the consideration he paid for his lease being
a hundred marcs (£66 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>). Early in the second year of
his lease, that is between Michaelmas, 1129, and Easter, 1130,
he must have been superseded by the royal <i>custodes</i>, on the
king taking the county into his own hands. He, however,
received "compensation for disturbance," four-fifths of his
hundred marcs ("de Gersoma") being remitted to him in
consideration of his losing four out of his five years' lease. All
this we learn from the brief record in the Roll (p. 63).</p>

<p>Another point that should be here noticed is the use of
the term "Gersoma." Retrospectively, its use in this Roll
illustrates its use in Domesday. In those cases, where a
<i>firmarius</i> was willing, as a speculation, to give for an estate
more than its fixed rental (<i>firma</i>), he gave the excess "de
Gersoma," either in the form of a lump sum, or in that of an
annual payment.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX J.<br />
<small>THE GREAT SEAL OF THE EMPRESS.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_116">116</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">There</span>
yet remains one point, in connection with this remarkable
charter, perhaps the most striking, certainly the most novel,
of all. This is that of the seal. According to the transcript in
the Ashmole MSS., the legend "in circumferentia sigillo" was
this: "Matildis Imperatrix Rom' et Regina Angliæ."</p>

<p>Now, that any such seal was designed for the Empress has
never been suspected by any historian. We cannot, on a
question of royal seals, appeal to a higher or more recognized
authority than Mr. Walter de Gray Birch. He has written as
follows on the subject:—</p>

<p class="small">"The type of seal of the empress which is invariably fixed to every
document among this collection that bears a seal is that used by her in
Germany as 'Queen of the Romans.'... From this date (1106) to that of
her death, which took place on the 16th of December, <small>A.D.</small> 1167, long after the
solution of the troubles of the years 1140-1142 in England, she was accustomed
to use this seal, and this only. It has never been suggested by any
writer upon the historic seals of England that Mathildis employed any
Great Seal as Queen of England, made after the conventional characteristics
which obtain in the Great Seals of Stephen, her predecessor, or of her son,
King Henry II. The troubled state of this country, the uncertain movements
of the lady, the unsettled confidence of the people, and the consequent
inability of attending to such a matter as the engraving of a Great Seal—a
work, it must be borne in mind, involving some time and care—are, when
taken together, more than sufficient causes to account for the continued usage
of this type; although we may fairly presume that it was intended to supersede
this foreign seal with one more consentaneously in keeping with English
tradition."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_872" id="Ref_872" href="#Foot_872">[872]</a></span></p>

<p>The seal to which Mr. Birch refers bore the legend
"Mathildis dei Gratia Romanorum regina."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
The question, of course, at once arises as to the amount of
reliance that can be placed on the above transcriber's note.
For my part, while fully admitting the right to reject such
evidence, I cannot believe that any transcriber would for his
own private gratification have forged such a legend, which he
could not hope to foist upon the world, if it were indeed a
forgery, since a reference to the original would at once expose
him.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_873" id="Ref_873" href="#Foot_873">[873]</a></span> And it is quite certain that we cannot account for it by
any misreading, however gross. A comparison of the two
legends will put this out of the question:—</p>

<p class="center smc">Mathildis dei gratia Romanorum regina.<br />
Matildis Imperatrix Rom' et regina Angliæ.</p>

<p>If we accept the fact, and believe the legend genuine, the
first point to strike us is the substitution of "<i>Imperatrix</i>" for
"<i>Regina</i> Romanorum."</p>

<p>It is passing strange that Maud should have retained, indeed
that she should ever have possessed, a seal which gave her no
higher style than that of "Queen of the Romans." It is true
that at the time of her actual betrothal (1110), her husband was
not, in strictness, "emperor," not having yet been crowned at
Rome; yet the performance of that ceremony a few months later
(April, 1111) made him fully "emperor." At the time therefore
of their marriage and joint coronation (1114), they were,
one would imagine, "emperor" and "empress;" and indeed we
read in the <i>Lüneburg Chronicle</i>, "dar makede he se to <i>keiserinne</i>."
At the same time, as has been well observed, "matters of phrase
and title are never unimportant, least of all in an age ignorant
and superstitiously antiquarian,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_874" id="Ref_874" href="#Foot_874">[874]</a></span> and there must be some good
reason for what appears to be a singular contradiction, though
the point is overlooked by Mr. Birch. Two explanations
suggest themselves. The one is that while Henry was fully
and strictly "emperor," having been duly crowned at Rome,
his wife, having only been crowned in Germany (1114), was not
entitled to the style of "empress," but only to that of "Queen
of the Romans." As against this, it would seem impossible
that the wife of a crowned emperor can have been anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
but an empress. Moreover, from the pleadings of her advocate
at Rome, in 1136 (see p. 257 <i>n.</i>), we learn incidentally that she
had duly been "anointed to empress." The only other explanation
is that her seal had been engraved in 1110—when the
emperor was, as I have shown, only "Rex Romanorum"—and
had not been altered since.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that a seal is evidence of
formal style, and not of current phraseology. In spite of the
efforts of Messrs. Bryce and Freeman to insist on accuracy in
the matter, it is certain that at the time of which I write a
most loose usage prevailed. Thus William of Malmesbury,
although he specially records the solemn coronation of Henry V.
as "Imperator Romanorum," at Rome in 1111, speaks of him
as "Imperator Alemanniæ," or "Imperator Alemannorum,"
both before and after that event. This circumstance is the
more notable, because I cannot find that style recognized in
Mr. Bryce's work, where the terms "German Emperor" and
"Emperor of Germany" are treated as recent corruptions.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_875" id="Ref_875" href="#Foot_875">[875]</a></span> Its
common use in the twelfth century is shown by the scene, in
the next reign, between Herbert of Bosham and the king
(May 1, 1166), when the latter takes the former to task for
speaking of Frederick as "King," not as "Emperor" <i>of the
Germans</i>. Had Henry enjoyed the advantage of sitting under
our own professors, he would have insisted on Frederick being
styled Emperor <i>of the Romans</i>; but as he lived in the twelfth
century, he employed, to the annoyance of modern pedants, the
current language of his day.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_876" id="Ref_876" href="#Foot_876">[876]</a></span></p>

<p>It was natural and fitting that, the legend on her seal being
at variance with her style, the Empress should embrace the
opportunity afforded, by the making of a wholly new seal, to
bring the two into harmony.</p>

<p>The next point is the adoption of the form "Angliæ," not
"Anglorum." This, at first sight, seemed suspicious. For
though the abbreviation found in charters ("Angl'") might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
stand for "Anglorum" or for "Angliæ," the legend on the
seal of Stephen, as on that of Henry I., contains the form
"Anglorum;" and Matilda styled herself in her charters
"Anglorum" (not "Anglie) Domina." But the remarkable
fact that both the queens of Henry I. bore on their seals the
legend "Sigillum ... Reginæ Ang<i>lie</i>" led me to the conclusion
that, so far from impugning, this form actually confirmed
the genuineness of the alleged legend.</p>

<p>It will doubtless be asked why this seal should have been
affixed, so far as we know, to this charter alone. But it is
precisely this that gives it so great an interest. For this is the
only known instance of an original charter, still surviving,
belonging to the brief but eventful period of the Empress's stay
at Westminster on the eve of her intended coronation.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_877" id="Ref_877" href="#Foot_877">[877]</a></span> It
may safely be presumed that a Great Seal was made in readiness
for this event, and that its legend would necessarily include the
style of "Queen of England." The Empress, in at least two
of her charters, had already, though irregularly, assumed this
style,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_878" id="Ref_878" href="#Foot_878">[878]</a></span> and was clearly eager to adopt it. As to her retention
of her foreign style on her seal as an English sovereign, it
might be suggested that she clung to the loftiest style of all<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_879" id="Ref_879" href="#Foot_879">[879]</a></span>
from that haughty pride which was to prove fatal to her
claims; but it is more likely that she found it needful to
distinguish thus her style from that of her rival's queen. For
by a singular coincidence, they would both have had, in the
ordinary course, upon their seals precisely the same legend,
viz. "Mathildis dei gratia Regina Anglie."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_880" id="Ref_880" href="#Foot_880">[880]</a></span></p>

<p>We may then, I think, thus account for the presence of this
seal at Westminster, and for its use, with characteristic eagerness,
by the Empress on this occasion. We may also no less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
satisfactorily account for the fact that it was never used again.
For this, indeed, the events that followed the fall of the Empress
from her high estate, and the virtual collapse of her hopes, may
be held sufficiently to account. But it is quite possible that in
the headlong flight of the Empress and her followers from
Westminster, the Great Seal may have fallen, with the rest of
her abandoned treasure, into the hands of her triumphant foes.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX K.<br />
<small>GERVASE DE CORNHILL.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">Few</span>
discoveries, in the course of these researches, have afforded
me more satisfaction and pleasure than that of the origin of
Gervase de Cornhill, the founder of an eminent and wealthy
house, and himself a great City magnate who played, we shall
find, no small part in the affairs of an eventful time.</p>

<p>The peculiar interest of the story lies in the light it throws
on the close amalgamation of the Normans and the English,
even in the days of Henry I., thereby affording a perfect
illustration of the well-known passage in the <i>Dialogus</i>:—</p>

<p class="small">"Jam cohabitantibus Anglicis et Normannis, et alterutrum uxores
ducentibus vel nubentibus, sic permixtæ sunt nationes, ut vix discerni possit
hodie, de liberis loquor, quis Anglicus, quis Normannus sit genere."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_881" id="Ref_881" href="#Foot_881">[881]</a></span></p>

<p>It also affords us a welcome glimpse of the territorial aristocracy
of the City, as yet its ruling class.</p>

<p>It has hitherto been supposed, as in Foss's work, that
Gervase de Cornhill first appears in 1155-56 (2 Hen. II.),
in which year he figures on the Pipe-Roll as one of the sheriffs
of London. I propose to show that he first appears a quarter
of a century before, and so to bridge over Stephen's reign, and
to connect the Pipe-Roll of Henry I. with the earliest Pipe-Rolls
of Henry II. The problem before us is this. We have
to identify the "Gervasius filius Rogeri nepotis Huberti," who
figures prominently on the Pipe-Roll of 1130 (31 Hen. I.),
with "Gervase, Justiciary of London," who meets us twice
under Stephen, with "Gervase" who was one of the sheriffs
of London in 1155 and 1156, and with Gervase de Cornhill,
whose name occurs at least twice under Stephen, and innumerable
times under Henry II., both in a public and private capacity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
Let us first identify Gervase de Cornhill with Gervase, the
Justiciary of London. The latter personage occurs once in the
legend on the seal affixed to "a 'star' with Hebrew words,"
which reads, "Sigillum Gervas' justitia' Londoniar';"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_882" id="Ref_882" href="#Foot_882">[882]</a></span> and once
in a charter which confirms this legend, dealing, as it does, with
a grant: "Gervasio Justic' de Lond'."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_883" id="Ref_883" href="#Foot_883">[883]</a></span> But the land (in
Gamlingay) granted to "Gervase, Justiciary of London," is
entered in a survey of the reign of John as held by "the heirs of
Gervase <i>de Cornhill</i>" (see p. 121). Similarly, the land mortgaged
in the former transaction to "Gervase, Justiciary of London," is
afterwards found in possession of Henry, son and heir of
Gervase <i>de Cornhill</i>. Thus is established the identity of the two.</p>

<p>The identity of the Gervase who thus flourished in the
reigns of Stephen and Henry II. with the Gervase fitz Roger
of 1130 must next occupy our attention. Here are the entries
relating to the latter:—</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"Radulfus filius Ebrardi debet cc marcas argenti pro placitis pecunie
Rogeri nepotis Huberti."</p>

<p>"Andreas bucca uncta reddit compotum de lxiiij libris et vii solidis et viiij
denariis pro xx libratis terre de terra Rogeri nepotis Huberti."</p>

<p>"Johannes filius Radulfi filii Ebrardi et Robertus frater suus reddunt
Compotum de <span class="smc">dcccc</span> et ij marcis argenti iiij denarios minus de debitis Gervasii
filii Rogeri pro totâ terrâ patris sui exceptis xx libratis terræ quas rex
retinuit ad opus Andr' bucca uncta.... Et Idem debent iij marcas auri
pro concessione terrarum quas Gervasius eis dedit."</p>

<p>"Ingenolda uxor Rogeri Nepotis Huberti debet ij marcas auri ut habeat
maritagium et dotem et res suas."</p>

<p>"Gervasius filius Rogeri nepotis Huberti debet vj libras et xii solidos et
vj denarios de debitis patris sui."</p>

<p>"Robertus filius Radufi et Johannes frater ejus reddunt Compotum de iij
marcis auri ut rex concederet eis vadimonium et terras quas Gervasius eis
concessit."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_884" id="Ref_884" href="#Foot_884">[884]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>These entries are explained by the charter subjoined, which
shows how John and Robert came to have charge of the estate:—</p>

<p class="small">"H. rex Angl[orum] Vic' Lund' et omnibus Baronibus et Vicecomitibus
in quorum Bailiis Gervasius filius Rogeri terram habet salutem. Precipio
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
quod Gervasius filius Rogeri sit saisitus et tenens de omnibus terris et
rebus patris sui sicut pater ejus erat die quo movit ire ad Jerosolimam....
Et ipse et tota terra sua interim sint in custodia et saisina Johannis et
Roberti filiorum Radulfi.... T. Comite Gloecestrie. Apud West'."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_885" id="Ref_885" href="#Foot_885">[885]</a></span></p>

<p>John fitz Ralph (fitz Ebrard) was another London magnate,
who was more or less connected with Gervase throughout his
career. He is found with him at St. Albans, late in Stephen's
reign, witnessing a charter of the king;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_886" id="Ref_886" href="#Foot_886">[886]</a></span> and the two men, as
"Gervase and John," were joint sheriffs of London in 2 Hen. II.
He is also the first witness to one of Gervase's charters after
his brother Alan.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_887" id="Ref_887" href="#Foot_887">[887]</a></span></p>

<p>We further find Gervase fitz Roger excused (in the Pipe-Roll
of 1130) the payment of two shillings "de veteri Danegeldo"
(? 1127-28) in Middlesex, and seven shillings "de preterito
Danegeldo" (1128-29) because his land is "waste."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_888" id="Ref_888" href="#Foot_888">[888]</a></span> The
inference to be drawn from all these passages is that Gervase
had then (1130) recently succeeded his father, a man of unusual
wealth and considerable property in land. We should therefore
expect to find him, in his turn, a man of some importance,
as was our own Gervase the Justiciar (<i>alias</i> Gervase de Cornhill),
the only Gervase who meets us as a man of any consequence.
Fortunately, however, we are not dependent on
mere inference. The manor of Chalk was granted by the
Crown to Roger "nepos Huberti;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_889" id="Ref_889" href="#Foot_889">[889]</a></span> it was subsequently
regranted to Gervase de Cornhill,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_890" id="Ref_890" href="#Foot_890">[890]</a></span> whom I identify with
Gervase his son. Moreover, the adoption by Gervase of the
surname "de Cornhill" can, as it happens, be accounted for.
Among the records of the duchy of Lancaster is a grant by
William, Archbishop of Canterbury (1123-1136), of land at
"Eadintune" to Gervase and Agnes his wife, Agnes being
described as daughter of "Godeleve."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_891" id="Ref_891" href="#Foot_891">[891]</a></span> By the aid of another
document relating to the same property,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_892" id="Ref_892" href="#Foot_892">[892]</a></span> we identify this
"Godeleve" as the wife of Edward de Cornhill. To the eye
of a trained genealogist all is thus made clear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">{307}</a></span></p>

<p>But we now find ourselves in the midst of a most interesting
family connection. For these same records carry us back to the
father of this "Godeleve," namely, Edward of Southwark.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_893" id="Ref_893" href="#Foot_893">[893]</a></span> It
is true that here he figures merely as a "æ. desudwerc," but
we have only to turn to another quarter, and there we find
"Edwardo de Suthwerke et Willelmo filio ejus" among the
leading witnesses to the invaluable document recording the
surrender by the English Cnihtengild of their soke to
the priory of Christchurch (1125).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_894" id="Ref_894" href="#Foot_894">[894]</a></span> I need scarcely lay stress
on the interest and importance of everything bearing on that
remarkable and as yet mysterious institution. We find ourselves
now brought into actual contact with the gild. For in
one of its members, as named in that document, "Edwardus
Hupcornhill," we recognize no other than that "Edward of
Cornhill" who was son-in-law to "Edward of Southwark."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_895" id="Ref_895" href="#Foot_895">[895]</a></span>
Following up our man in yet another quarter, we find him
witnessing a London deed (<i>temp.</i> William the Dean),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_896" id="Ref_896" href="#Foot_896">[896]</a></span> and
another one of about the middle of the reign of Henry I.,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_897" id="Ref_897" href="#Foot_897">[897]</a></span>
though wrongly assigned in the (Hist. MSS.) Report to "about
1127."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_898" id="Ref_898" href="#Foot_898">[898]</a></span> Lastly, turning to still another quarter, we find his
name among those of the witnesses to an agreement between
Ramsey Abbey and the priory of Christchurch soon after 1125.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_899" id="Ref_899" href="#Foot_899">[899]</a></span></p>

<p>We are now in a position to construct this remarkable
pedigree:—</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">{308}</a></div>

<pre>

                                       Edward of Southwark,
                                           living 1125.
                                                |

              |                         |
              |              +----------+
              |              |
           Gervase    =    Agnes
          Fitz Roger    de Cornhill,
         (afterwards     married
          Gervase de     before 1136.
          Cornhill).

</pre>

<p>I say that this is a remarkable pedigree because, from the
dates, Edward of Southwark must have been born within a
very few years of the Conquest, and also because we can feel
sure, in the case both of him and of his son-in-law, that we are
dealing with men of the old stock, connected with the venerable
gild of English "Cnihts." But it further shows us how the
elder of the two bestowed on his English son the name of the
Norman Conqueror, and how the Norman settlers intermarried
with the English stock.</p>

<p>Let us now return to the father of Gervase, Roger "nepos
Huberti." Here, again, there come to our help the records of
the duchy of Lancaster. Among them are two royal charters,
the first of which grants to Roger the manor of Chalk, in
Kent,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_900" id="Ref_900" href="#Foot_900">[900]</a></span> while the second was consequent on his death,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_901" id="Ref_901" href="#Foot_901">[901]</a></span> and
should be read in connection with the above extracts from the
Pipe-Roll of 1130. This charter has a special interest from its
mention of the fact that Roger had gone "ad Jerosolima."
We may infer from this that he had died on pilgrimage.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_902" id="Ref_902" href="#Foot_902">[902]</a></span> As
Gervase inherited from his father so large an estate, Roger
must have been, in his day, a man of some consequence. It
is, therefore, rather strange that his name does not occur in the
report on the muniments of St. Paul's, nor in any other quarter
to which I have been able to refer. Luckily, however, Stow
has preserved for us the gist of a document which he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">{309}</a></span>
seen, when he tells us that on the grant of their soke, in 1125,
by the Cnihtengild—</p>

<p class="small">"The king sent also his sheriffs, to wit Aubrey de Vere and <i>Roger
nephew to Hubert</i>, which (upon his behalf) should invest this church with
the possessions thereof; which the said sheriffs accomplished, coming upon
the ground, Andrew Buchevite<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_903" id="Ref_903" href="#Foot_903">[903]</a></span> and the forenamed witnesses and others
standing by."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_904" id="Ref_904" href="#Foot_904">[904]</a></span></p>

<p>If we can trust to this passage, as I believe we certainly
can, our Roger was a sheriff of London in 1125. This makes
it highly probable that he was identical with the "Roger"
named in a document addressed, a few years earlier:—</p>

<p class="small">"Hugoni de Bocheland, <i>Rogero</i>, Leofstano, Ordgaro, et omnibus aliis
baronibus Lundoniæ."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_905" id="Ref_905" href="#Foot_905">[905]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not know of any other Roger who is likely to have been
thus addressed.</p>

<p>We are given by Gervase de Cornhill a further clue as to
his parentage in a charter of his, under Henry II., in which he
mentions Ralph fitz Herlwin as his uncle ("avunculus").
Ralph fitz Herlwin was in 1130 joint-Sheriff of London.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_906" id="Ref_906" href="#Foot_906">[906]</a></span> This
clue, therefore, is worth following up. Now, Ralph must either
have been a brother of the father or of the mother of Gervase.
It is highly improbable that Ralph "filius Herlwini" was a
brother of Roger "nepos Huberti," each of the two being
always mentioned by the same distinctive suffix. It may,
therefore, be presumed that Ralph was brother to Roger's wife.
Now, we happen to have two documents which greatly concern
this Ralph and his son, and which belong to one transaction,
although they figure widely apart in the report on the muniments
of St. Paul's.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_907" id="Ref_907" href="#Foot_907">[907]</a></span> Nicholas, son of Ælfgar, parish priest of
the church of St. Michael's, Cheap, a living which, like his
father before him, he held at lease from St. Paul's, exercised
his right to the next presentation in favour of a son of Ralph
fitz Herlwin, who had married his niece Mary. From the
evidence now in our possession, we may construct this pedigree:—</p>

<p>It will have been noticed that in this pedigree I assign to
Gervase a brother Alan. I do so on the strength of a charter
of Archbishop Theobald, late in the reign of Stephen, to Holy
Trinity, witnessed <i>inter alios</i> by "Gervasio de Cornhill et Alano
fratre ejus,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_912" id="Ref_912" href="#Foot_912">[912]</a></span> also of a charter I have seen (Duchy of Lanc.,
<i>Cart. Misc.</i>, ii. 57), in which the first witness to a charter of
Gervase is Alan, his brother. The "Roger fitz Alan" for
whom I suggest an affiliation to this Alan occurs among the
witnesses to a grant made by Ralph, and witnessed by Reginald
de Cornhill.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_913" id="Ref_913" href="#Foot_913">[913]</a></span> This suggests such paternity, and his name,
Roger, would then be derived from Roger, his paternal grandfather.
We have here, at least, another clue which ought to
be followed up, for Roger fitz Alan is repeatedly found among
the leading witnesses to London documents of the close of the
twelfth and beginning of the thirteenth centuries, his career
culminating in his appointment as mayor on the death of the
well-known "Henry fitz Ailwin" in 1212.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_914" id="Ref_914" href="#Foot_914">[914]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that Gervase and Alan were brothers tempts one
to recognize in them the "Alanus juvenis et Gervasius fratres,"
who witness a grant to (their cousin) Robert fitz Ralph fitz
Herlwin,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_915" id="Ref_915" href="#Foot_915">[915]</a></span> and the "Alanus juvenis" and "Gervasius frater
Alani" of a similar document.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_916" id="Ref_916" href="#Foot_916">[916]</a></span> But, unluckily, we find this
same Alan elsewhere styled "Alanus filius <i>Huberti</i> juvenis."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_917" id="Ref_917" href="#Foot_917">[917]</a></span>
Possibly they were sons of that Hubert to whom his father
was "nepos." But the question, for the present, must be left
in doubt.</p>

<p>Both Gervase de Cornhill and Henry his son appear, it may
be added, from the evidence of charters, to have lent money
on mortgage, and to have acquired landed property by foreclosing.
A curious allusion to the mercantile origin and the
profitable money-lending transactions of Geoffrey is found in a
sneer of Becket's biographer, when, as Sheriff of Kent, he
opposed the primate's landing.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_918" id="Ref_918" href="#Foot_918">[918]</a></span> The contemporary allusion to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">{312}</a></span>
such pursuits, in the <i>Dialogus</i>, breathes the same scornful spirit
for the trader and all his works.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_919" id="Ref_919" href="#Foot_919">[919]</a></span> Gervase, I think, may
have been that "Gervase" who, at the head of the citizens of
London, met Henry II. in 1174 (<i>Fantosme</i>, l. 1941); he would
seem to have lived on till 1183, and was probably, at his
death, between seventy and seventy-five years old. Among his
descendants were a Dean of St. Paul's (1243-1254) and a
Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield (1215-1223).</p>

The curious form "Hupcornhill" should, of course, be noted. I have
met with a similar form at Colchester, where the name "Opethewalle," which
has been supposed to have been connected with the town wall, occurs earlier
(under Edward I.) as "Opethehelle," <i>i.e.</i> up the hill. The idiom still survives
in such forms as "up town" and "up the street." It probably accounts for
the strange name, "Hoppeoverhumber," <i>i.e.</i> a man who came from "up
beyond the Humber" (cf. for aspirate "Huppelanda de Berchamstede").</p>

(<i>b</i>) that Ralph fitz Herlwin was brother to the mother, not the father, of
Gervase. These assumptions seem tolerably certain, but, at present, they

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">As</span>
this important charter has never, I believe, been printed, I
have taken the present opportunity of publishing it <i>in extenso</i>.
The grantee must, at first, have staunchly supported Stephen,
for he received in 1139, from the king, a grant of that constableship
which Miles of Gloucester had forfeited on his defection.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_920" id="Ref_920" href="#Foot_920">[920]</a></span>
It is evident, however, from the terms of this charter that he
was jealous of Stephen's favourite, Gualeran, Count of Meulan,
and of the power which the king had given him at Worcester.
The grant of Tamworth also should be carefully noted, because
that portion of the Despencer inheritance had fallen to the
share of Marmion, which suggests that the Beauchamps and
the Marmions were at strife, and that therefore, in this struggle,
they embraced opposite sides. An intermarriage between Robert
Marmion and Maud de Beauchamp was probably, as in other
cases, a compromise of the quarrel.</p>

There can, I think, be little question that this charter
passed at Oxford just after that by which Miles of Gloucester
was created Earl of Hereford (July 25, 1141). It is certainly
previous to the Earl of Gloucester's departure from England
in the summer of 1142, and I do not know of any evidence for
the presence of these bishops with the Empress at Oxford after
the rout of Winchester. The names of the eight first witnesses
to this charter are all found in Miles's charter (<i>Fœdera, N.E.</i>, i.
14). As to the others, Miles de Beauchamp had held his castle
of Bedford against Stephen (Christmas, 1137), and, though
compelled to surrender it, had regained it on the triumph of
the Empress. Stephen de Beauchamp heads the list of William
de Beauchamp's under-tenants in his <i>Carta</i> (1166), and the
Abetots—Heming's "Ursini"—also held of him. "Isnardus"
was a landowner in Worcestershire and witnessed a charter
to Evesham Abbey in 1130.</p>

<p>The text of this charter—which is taken from the Beauchamp
Cartulary (<i>Add. MSS.</i>, 28,024, fol. 126 <i>b</i>), a most precious
volume, of which the existence is little known—is perhaps
corrupt in places, but the document affords several points of
considerable interest. Among them are the formula "dedi et
reddidi" applied to the grantee's previous possessions, as contrasted
with the "dedi et concessi" of the new grant (60
"librates" of land) and of the grant of his relatives' inheritance;
the reference to the hereditary shrievalty of Worcester;
the allusion to Tamworth Castle as the head of its "honour"
(as at Arundel); and the phrase "de hoc devenit ... meus
ligius homo contra omnes mortales," to be compared with "pro
hiis ... devenit homo noster ligius contra omnes homines"
in the charter (1144) to Humfrey de Bohun (Pipe-Roll
Society: <i>Ancient Charters</i>, p. 46), and the "homagium suum
fecit ligie contra omnes homines" in the charter to Miles of
Gloucester (see p. 56). The statement that active opponents
of the Empress were precluded from compounding for their
offence, except by special intervention, occurs, I think, here
alone. The facts that Urse de Abetot was a constable and Walter
de Beauchamp an hereditary "Dispenser" are also noteworthy,
the latter bearing on the question of the succession to Robert
"Dispensator" (see my remarks in <i>Ancient Charters</i>, p. 2).</p>

<small>THE EARLDOM OF ARUNDEL.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_146">146</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">It</span>
is difficult to overrate the importance of the Canterbury
charter to Geoffrey in its bearing on the origin and nature of
this far-famed earldom. For centuries, antiquaries and lawyers
have wrangled over this dignity, the premier earldom of
England, but its true character and history have remained an
unsolved enigma.</p>

<p>The popular belief that the dignity is "an earldom by
tenure" and is annexed to the possession of Arundel Castle,
is based on the petitions of John fitz Alan in 11 Hen. IV.
and of Thomas Howard in 3 Car. I. This view would be
strenuously upheld, of course, by the possessors of the castle,
but neither their own <i>ex parte</i> statements, nor even the tacit
admission of them by the Crown, can override the facts of the
case as established by the evidence of history. The problem
is for us, it should be added, of merely historical interest, as
the dignity is now, and has been since 1627, held under a
special parliamentary entail created in that year.</p>

<p>Even the warmest advocates of the "earldom by tenure"
theory would admit that such an anomaly was absolutely
unique of its kind. The <i>onus</i> of proving the fact must therefore
rest on them, and the presumption, to put it mildly, is
completely against them, for I do not hesitate to say that to a
student of the dignity of an earl the proposition they ask us to
accept is more than impossible: it is ludicrous.</p>

<p>Tierney endeavoured, with some skill, to rebut the arguments
of Lord Redesdale in the <i>Reports of the Lords' Committee</i>,
but the advance of historical research leaves them both behind.
The latest words on the subject have been spoken by Mr. Pym
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">{317}</a></span>
Yeatman, the confidence of whose assertions and the size of
whose work<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_921" id="Ref_921" href="#Foot_921">[921]</a></span> might convey the erroneous impression that he
had solved this ancient riddle. I shall therefore here examine
his arguments in some detail, and, having disposed of his
theories, shall then discuss the facts.</p>

<p>An enthusiastic champion of the "earldom by tenure"
theory, Mr. Yeatman has further advanced a view which is
quite peculiar to himself. So far as this view can be understood,
it "dimidiates" the first earl (d. 1176), and converts
him into two, viz. a father who died about 1156, and a son who
died in 1176. This is first described as "certain" (p. 281),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_922" id="Ref_922" href="#Foot_922">[922]</a></span>
then as "probable" (p. 288),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_923" id="Ref_923" href="#Foot_923">[923]</a></span> lastly, as "possible" (p. 285).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_924" id="Ref_924" href="#Foot_924">[924]</a></span>
But when we look for the foundation of the theory, and for
evidence that the first earl died in 1156, we only read, to our
confusion, that the doings of the Becket earl are "possibly" to
be attributed to "his [the first earl's] son, and we must come to
that conclusion, if we believe the only evidence we possess in
relation to the death of his father in 1156; at any rate, before
it is rejected some reason should be shown for doing so."
Yet the only scrap of "evidence" given us is the incidental
remark (p. 283) that "the year 1156 is usually assigned as
that of the death of the first Earl of Arundel." Now, this is
directly contrary to fact. For Mr. Yeatman himself tells us
that Dugdale's is "the generally received account" (p. 282),
and Dugdale, like every one else, kills the first earl in 1176.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_925" id="Ref_925" href="#Foot_925">[925]</a></span>
Again, it is "very certain," we learn, that the Earl of Arundel
"died the 3rd (<i>sic</i>) of October, 1176" (p. 281), while "Diceto
is the authority for the statement that William Albini, Earl of
Arundel, died the 17th (<i>sic</i>) of October, 1176" (p. 285), the
actual words of the chronicler being given as "iv. die Octobus"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">{318}</a></span>
(<i>sic</i>). Now, all three dates, as a matter of fact, are wrong,
though this is only introduced to show how the laborious researches
of the author are marred by a carelessness which is
fatal to his work.</p>

<p>Let us now turn to this argument:—</p>

<p class="small">"The foundation charter of Bungay, in Suffolk, contains the first entry
known to the author of the title of Earl of Sussex. It was founded in 1160
by Roger de Glanville.... This charter seems to confirm the statement
that the first Earl of Arundel died about 1156. If not, he too was styled
Earl of Sussex. It disposes as well of the theory that the first (<i>sic</i>) Earl
of Arundel was so created<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_926" id="Ref_926" href="#Foot_926">[926]</a></span> in 1176" (p. 284).</p>

<p>This argument is based on the fact that the house was
"founded in 1160." The <i>Monasticon</i> editors indeed say that
this was "about" the date, but, unluckily, a moment's examination
of the list of witnesses to the charter shows that its date
must be much later,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_927" id="Ref_927" href="#Foot_927">[927]</a></span> while Mr. Eyton unhesitatingly assigns
it to 1188. All the above argument, therefore, falls to the
ground.</p>

<p>Another point on which the author insists as of great
importance is that the first earl was never Earl of <i>Sussex</i>:—</p>

<div class="small">

<p>"The first Earl of Arundel was never called Earl of Sussex, nor did he
bear that title.... His son was the first Earl of Sussex, and he would
certainly have given his father the higher title if he ever bore it. Yet in
confirming his charter to Wymondham, William, Earl of Sussex, confirms
the grants of his ... father, William, the venerable Earl of Arundel....
An earl could not call himself the earl of a county unless he had a grant of
it, and of this, with respect to the husband of Queen Adeliza, there is no
evidence" (p. 282).</p>

<p>"That his son was called Earl of Sussex, and that he was the first earl,
is equally clear" (p. 282).</p>

<p>"The chartulary of the Abbey of Buckenham, which the first Earl of
Arundel founded, preserves the distinction in the titles of himself and his
son and successor already insisted upon. It was founded <i>tempe</i> Stephen,
and the founder is styled William, Count of Chichester. William, Count of
Sussex, confirms the charter" (p. 284).</p>

</div>

<p>But on the very next page he demolishes his own argument
by quoting Hoveden to the effect that "Willielmus (<i>sic</i>) de
Albineio filio Willielmi Comitis de <i>Arundel</i> [Rex] dedit comitatum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">{319}</a></span>
de <i>Southsex</i>." For here his own rule would require that
if the late earl was, as he admits, Earl of <i>Sussex</i>, he would not
be described as Earl of <i>Arundel</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_928" id="Ref_928" href="#Foot_928">[928]</a></span></p>

<p>But, in any case, the still existing charter to Geoffrey de
Mandeville (1141), which the earl attests as "Earl of Sussex"
(evidence which does not stand alone), is absolutely conclusive
on the subject, and simply annihilates Mr. Yeatman's attempts
to deny to the husband of Queen Adeliza the possession of that
title.</p>

<p>With this there falls to the ground the argument based on
that denial, viz.:—</p>

<p class="small">"There is another argument which appears to have been lost sight of,
which proves distinctly that there was (<i>sic</i>) at least five earls, and probably
six, of the name of William de Albini. The record of the 12 Henry III.
which was made after the last earl of that name was dead three years proves
that there were four Earls of Sussex.... Now, the first Earl of Arundel
was never called Earl of Sussex, nor did he bear that title," etc. (p. 282).</p>

<p>The above argument that the record in question proves the
existence of <i>five</i>, not of four, earls thus falls to the ground.
But this is by no means all. Mr. Yeatman first asserts
(p. 281 <i>a</i>) that there were five Albini Earls of Arundel in all,
"if indeed there were not six of them." Deducting the last
earl, Hugh de Albini, this leaves us <i>four</i> or <i>five</i> Earl Williams
in succession. Yet on the very next page he urges it (in the
above passage) as "distinctly proved" that "there was (<i>sic</i>) at
least <i>five</i> earls, and probably <i>six</i>, of the name of William de
Albini." And, lastly, on p. 284, he announces that "there
must have been <i>six</i>"!</p>

<p>We will now dismiss from our minds all that has been
written on the point by Mr. Yeatman and other antiquaries,
and turn to the facts of the case, which are few and beyond
dispute. It is absolutely certain, from the evidence of contemporary
chronicles and charters, that the first Albini earl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">{320}</a></span>
the husband of Queen Adeliza, was indifferently styled at the
time (1) Earl of Sussex, (2) Earl of Chichester, (3) Earl of
Arundel, (4) Earl William de Albini. The proofs of user of
these styles are as follows. First, he attests as Earl of Sussex
the Canterbury charter to the Earl of Essex (Christmas, 1141);<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_929" id="Ref_929" href="#Foot_929">[929]</a></span>
he also attests as Earl of Sussex Stephen's charter to Barking
Abbey, which may have passed about the same time. As this
charter is of importance for the argument, I append the full
list of witnesses as extracted by me from the Patent Rolls:—</p>

<p class="small">"Matild[a] Regina &amp; Will[elm]o Comite de Sudsexa, &amp; Will[elm]o
Mart[el], &amp; Adam de Belum, &amp; Rog[ero] de Fraxin[eto] &amp; Reinald[o] fil[io]
Comitis, &amp; Henr[ico] de Novo Mercato, &amp; Ric[ard]o de Valderi, &amp; Godefrid[o]
de Petrivilla, &amp; Warn[erio] de Lusoris, Apud Berching[es].<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_930" id="Ref_930" href="#Foot_930">[930]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, it is as "Earl of Chichester" that he attests four
charters,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_931" id="Ref_931" href="#Foot_931">[931]</a></span> one of which is dated 1147, and is confirmed by King
Stephen as the grant "quod Comes Willelmus de <i>Arundel</i> fecit;"
it is also as Earl of Chichester that he appears in the Buckenham
foundation charter,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_932" id="Ref_932" href="#Foot_932">[932]</a></span> and that he confirms the grants to
Boxgrove.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_933" id="Ref_933" href="#Foot_933">[933]</a></span> As to the two other styles no question arises.</p>

<p>Thus the case of the earldom of Arundel is one of special
interest in its bearing on the adoption of comital titles. For it
affords, according to the view I have advanced, an example of
the use, in a single case, of all the four possible varieties of an
earl's title. These four possible varieties are those in which
the title is taken (1) from the county of which the bearer is
earl, (2) from the capital town of that county, (3) from the
earl's chief residence, (4) from his family name. Strictly
speaking, when an earl was created, it was always (whatever
may be pretended) as the earl of a particular county. The
earl and his county were essentially correlative; nor was it
then possible to conceive an earl unattached to a county.
Titles, however, like surnames in that period of transition, had
not yet crystallized into a hard and fast form, and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">{321}</a></span>
deemed unnecessary, when speaking of an earl, that his county
should always be mentioned. Men spoke of "Earl Geoffrey,"
or of "Geoffrey, Earl of Essex," just as they spoke of "King
Henry," or of "Henry, King of the English." If the simple
"Earl Geoffrey" was not sufficiently distinctive, they added
his surname, or his residence, or his county for the purpose of
identification. The secondary importance of this addition is
the key to Norman polyonomy. The founder, for instance, of
the house of Clare was known as Richard "Fitz-Gilbert," or
"de Tunbridge," or "de Bienfaite," or "de Clare." The
result of this system, or rather want of system, was, as we
might expect, in the case of earls, that no fixed principle guided
the adoption of their styles. It was indeed a matter of haphazard
which of their <i>cognomina</i> prevailed, and survived to
form the style by which their descendants were known. Thus,
the Earls of Herts and of Surrey, of Derby and of Bucks, were
usually spoken of by their family names of Clare and of
Warenne, of Ferrers and of Giffard; on the other hand the
Earls of Norfolk and of Essex, of Devon and of Cornwall, were
more usually styled by those of their counties. Where the name
of the county was formed from that of its chief town, the latter,
rather than the county itself, was adopted for the earl's style.
Familiar instances are found in the earldoms of Chester,
Gloucester, and Hereford, of Lincoln, of Leicester, and of
Warwick. Rarest, perhaps, are those cases in which the earl
took his style from his chief residence, as the Earls of Pembroke(shire)
from Striguil (Chepstow), and, perhaps, of Wiltshire
from Salisbury, though here the case is a doubtful one, for
"de Salisbury" was already the surname of the family when
the earldom was conferred upon it. The Earl of Gloucester is
spoken of by the Continuator of Florence of Worcester as "Earl
of Bristol" (see p. 284), and the Earls of Derby occasionally as
Earls "of Tutbury," but the most remarkable case, of course, is
that of Arundel itself. It was doubtful for a time by which style
this earldom would eventually be known, and "Sussex," under
Henry II., seemed likely to prevail. The eventual adoption of
Arundel was, no doubt, largely due to the importance of that
"honour" and of the castle which formed its "head."</p>

<p>Having now established that the earldom of "Arundel"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">{322}</a></span>
was from the first the earldom of a county, and thus similar
to every other, one is led to inquire on what ground there is
claimed for it an absolutely unique and wholly anomalous
origin. I reply: on none whatever. There is nothing to
rebut the legitimate assumption that William de Albini was
created an earl in the ordinary course of things. Here, again,
the facts of the case, few and simple though they are, have
been so overlaid by assumption and by theory that it is
necessary to state them anew. All that has been hitherto
really known is that Queen Adeliza married William de Albini
between King Henry's death (December, 1135) and the landing
of the Empress in the autumn of 1139, and that her husband
subsequently appears as an earl. The assertion that he became
an earl on his marriage, in virtue of his possession of Arundel
Castle, is pure assumption and nothing else.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_934" id="Ref_934" href="#Foot_934">[934]</a></span> I have already
dwelt on the value of the Canterbury charter to Geoffrey as
evidence not only that William was Earl "of Sussex," but also
that he was already an earl at Christmas, 1141. In that charter
I claim to have discovered the earliest contemporary record
mention of this famous earldom.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_935" id="Ref_935" href="#Foot_935">[935]</a></span> William, therefore, became
an earl between Christmas, 1135, and Christmas, 1141. This
much is certain.</p>

<p>The key to the problem, however, is found in another
quarter. The curious and valuable <i>Chronicle of the Holy Cross
of Waltham</i> (<i>Harl. MS.</i>, 3776) was the work of one who was
acquainted—indeed, too well acquainted—with the persons and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">{323}</a></span>
the doings of those two nobles, Geoffrey de Mandeville and
William de Albini. His own neighbourhood became their battleground,
and when William harried Geoffrey's manors, and Geoffrey,
in revenge, fired Waltham, he was among the sufferers
himself.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_936" id="Ref_936" href="#Foot_936">[936]</a></span> The pictures he draws of these rival magnates are,
therefore, of peculiar interest, and his admiration for Geoffrey
is so remarkable, in the face of the earl's wild deeds, that no
apology is needed for quoting the description in full:—</p>

<p class="small">"E contra Gaufridus iste præcellens multiformi gratia, præcipuus totius
Anglie, militia quidem præclivis, morum venustate præclarus, in consiliis
regis et regni moderamine cunctis præminens, agebat se inter ceteros quasi
unus ex illis, nullius probitatis suæ garrulus, nullius probitatis sibi collatæ
vel dignitatis nimius ostensator, rei suæ familiaris providus dispensator,
omnium virtutum communium quæ tantum decerent virum affluentia exuberans,
si Dei gratiam diligentius acceptam et ceteris prelatam, diligens
executor menti suæ sedulus imprimeret; novit populus quod non mentior, quem
si laudibus extulerim, meritis ejus assignari potius quam gratiæ nostræ id
debere credimus, verumptamen gratiæ divinæ de cujus munere venit quicquid
boni provenit homini" (cap. 29).</p>

<p class="small">"Tempore igitur incendii supra memorati, dum observaret comes ille
ecclesiam cum multis ne succenderetur, amicissimus ipse et devotus ecclesiæ,
afflictus multo dolore quod periclitarentur res ecclesiæ (non tamen poterat
manentibus illis injuriam sibi illatam vindicare)," etc. (cap. 31).</p>

<p>As eager to denounce the character of William as to palliate
the excesses of Geoffrey, the chronicler thus sketches the
husband of Queen Adeliza:—</p>

<p class="small">"Seditionis tempore, cum se inæqualiter agerent homines in terra nostra,
et de pari contenderet modicus cum magno, humilis cum summo, et fide
penitus subacta, nullo respectu habito servi ad dominum, sic vacillaret
regnum et regni status miserabili ductore premeretur fere usque ad exanimationem,
e vicino contendebant inter se duo de præcipuis terræ baronibus,
Gaufridus de Mandeville, et Comes de Harundel, quem post discessum Regis
Henrici conjugio Reginæ Adelidis contigit honorari, unde et superbire et
supra se extolli cœpit ultra modum, ut [non] posset sibi pati parem, et
vilesceret in oculis suis quicquid præcipuum præter regem in se habebat
noster mundus. Habebat tunc temporis Willelmus ille, pincerna, nondum
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">{324}</a></span>
comes, dotem reginæ Waltham, contiguam terris comitis Gaufridi de
Mandeville, impatiens quidem omnium comprovincialium terras suo dominio
non mancipari.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_937" id="Ref_937" href="#Foot_937">[937]</a></span></p>

<p>In the words "nondum comes" we find the clue we seek.
If the writer had merely abstained from giving William his
title, the value of his evidence would be slight; but when he
goes, as it were, out of his way to inform us that though
William, in virtue of his marriage, was already in possession of
the queen's dower, he was "not yet an earl," he tells us, in
unmistakable language, the very thing that we want to know.
It was probably in order to accentuate his pride that his critic
reminds us that the future earl was as yet only a <i>pincerna</i>;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_938" id="Ref_938" href="#Foot_938">[938]</a></span>
but, whatever the motive, the fact remains, on first-hand
evidence, that William was "not yet an earl" at a time when
he possessed his wife's dower, and consequently Arundel Castle.
This fact, hitherto overlooked, is completely destructive of the
time-honoured belief that he acquired the earldom on, and by,
obtaining possession of the castle.</p>

<p>So far, all is clear. But the question is further complicated
by William appearing in two distinct documents as earl, not of
Arundel or Chichester, but of Lincoln! That he held this
title is a fact so utterly unsuspected, and indeed so incredible,
that Mr. Eyton, finding him so styled in a cartulary of Lewes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">{325}</a></span>
Priory, dismissed the title, without hesitation, as an obvious
error of the scribe.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_939" id="Ref_939" href="#Foot_939">[939]</a></span> But I have identified in the Public Record
Office the actual charter from which the scribe worked, and the
same style is there employed. Even so, error is possible; but
the evidence does not stand alone. In a cartulary of Reading<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_940" id="Ref_940" href="#Foot_940">[940]</a></span>
we find William confirming, as Earl of Lincoln, a grant from
the queen, his wife, and here again the original charter is there
to prove that the cartulary is right.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_941" id="Ref_941" href="#Foot_941">[941]</a></span> The early history of the
earldom of Lincoln is already difficult enough without this
additional complication, of which I do not attempt to offer any
solution.</p>

<p>But so far as the earldom of "Arundel" is concerned, I
claim to have established its true character, and to have shown
that there is nothing to distinguish it in its origin from the
other earldoms of the day. The erratic notion of "earldom by
tenure," held when the strangest views prevailed as to peerage
dignities, was a fallacy of the <i>post hoc propter hoc</i> kind, based on
the long connection of the castle with the earls. Nor has Mr.
Freeman's strange fancy that the holder of this earldom is "the
only one of his class left" any better foundation in fact.</p>

Mr. Yeatman attempts to get over this difficulty by suggesting that
"Henry's charter to William, Earl of Arundel, styling himself [? him]
incidentally Earl of Sussex, shows that these earls bore both titles [<i>i.e.</i>
Arundel and Sussex], just as the first earl was called of Chichester as well
as of Arundel" (p. 285). But this alternative use of Arundel and Sussex
is precisely what the author denies above, in the case of the first earl, as
impossible.</p>

It is not safe from the concurrence of only three witnesses to assign this

which it records is that of the hundred of Barstable, which Stephen offered

"Willelmus de Albinneio, qui duxerat Aeliz quondam reginam, quæ
habebat castellum et comitatum Harundel, quod rex Henricus dederat ei in
dote." The possession of Arundel by Queen Adeliza may probably be
accounted for by William of Malmesbury's statement that Henry I. had
settled Shropshire on her,—"uxori suæ ... comitatum Salopesberiæ dedit"
(ed. Stubbs, ii. 529),—for this would represent the forfeited inheritance of the
house of Montgomery, including Arundel and its rights over Sussex. A
curious incidental allusion in the <i>Dialogus</i> (i. 7) to "Salop, <i>Sudsex</i>, Northumberland,
et Cumberland" having only come to pay their <i>firmæ</i> to the
Crown "per incidentes aliquos casus," suggests that, like his neighbour in
Cheshire, Roger de Montgomery had palatine rights, including the <i>firmæ</i>
of both his counties, Shropshire and Sussex, which escheated to the Crown
on the forfeiture of his heir.</p>

There is a curious incidental allusion to the possession of Waltham by
the Earl of Arundel (jure uxoris) in the <i>Testa de Nevill</i> (p. 270 <i>b</i>). In an
inquisition of John's reign we have the entry: "Menigarus le Napier dicit
quod Rex Henricus, avus [<i>lege</i> proavus] domini Regis feodavit antecessores
suos per serjantiam de Naperie et dicit quod <i>quando comes de Arundel duxit
Reginam Aliciam in uxorem</i> removit illud servicium et fecit inde reddere
xx sol. per annum et predictus Menigarus tenet," etc. That is, that while
Waltham was in Henry's hands, he had enfeoffed this man's predecessor by
serjeanty, but that, this tenure becoming inept when the manor passed to a
private owner, the earl substituted for it an annual money rent. Note here
how Henry provided for his widow from escheats rather than Crown demesne,
and observe the origin of the name "Napier," comparing <i>Testa</i>, p. 115:
"Robertus Napparius habet feodum unius militis de hereditate uxoris suæ
... dominus Rex perdonavit predicto Roberto et heredibus ejus per cartam
suam predictum servicium militare per unam nappam de precio iii sol. vel
per tres solidos reddendo pro precio illius nappæ." And p. 118: "Thomas
Napar tenet terram suam ... per serjantiam reddendo singulis annis unam
nappam ... et debet esse naparius domini Regis."</p>

to be that of William, Earl of <i>Lincoln</i>, but is addressed to his barons
and men of the honour of Arundel. The mistake of the transcriber is
obvious" (<i>History of Shropshire</i>, ii. 273).</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">This</span>
personage, who, as charters show, was in constant attendance
on Stephen, is usually, and very naturally, taken by
genealogists, from Mr. Eyton downwards, for a younger brother
of Aubrey de Vere (the chamberlain) and uncle of the first
Earl of Oxford. He was, however, quite distinct, being a son
of Bernard de Vere. He owed his position to a marriage with
Adeline, daughter of Hugh de Montfort, as recorded on the
Pipe-Roll of 1130. By this marriage he became possessed of
the honour of Haughley ("Haganet"), and with it (it is
important to observe) of the office of constable, in which
capacity he figures among the witnesses to Stephen's Charter of
Liberties (1136). In conjunction with his wife he founded, on
her Kentish estate, the Cluniac priory of Monks Horton.
They were succeeded, in their tenure of the honour, by the
well-known Henry of Essex, who thus became constable in his
turn. As supporting this view that the honour carried the
constableship, attention may be drawn to its <i>compotus</i> as "Honor
Constabularie" in 1189-90 (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 1 Ric. I., pp. 14, 15),
just before that of the "Terra que fuit Henrici de Essex." It
is therefore worth consideration whether Robert de Montfort,
general to William Rufus—"strator Normannici exercitus hereditario
jure"—may not have really held the post of constable.</p>

<p>The history of the Montfort fief in Kent is of interest from
the Conquest downwards owing to its inclusion of Saltwood
and other estates claimed by the Archbishops of Canterbury.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_942" id="Ref_942" href="#Foot_942">[942]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">{327}</a></span>
Dugdale is terribly at sea in his account of the Montfort
descent, wrongly affiliating the Warwickshire Thurstan (ancestor
of the Lords Montfort) to the Kentish house, and confusing his
generations wholesale (especially in the case of Adeline, wife
of William de Breteuil).</p>

<p>The fact that Henry of Essex was appealed of treason and
defeated in the trial by battle by a Robert de Montfort (1163),
suggests that a grudge on the part of a descendant of the dispossessed
line against himself as possessor of their fief may
have been at the bottom of this somewhat mysterious affair.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smc">Note.</span>—Since the above was in type, there has appeared (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 15
Hen. II., p. 111) a most valuable <i>compotus</i> of the 'Honor Constabularie' (with
a misleading head-line) for 1169, proving that Gilbert de Gant had held it,
at one time, under Stephen, and had alienated nearly a third of it.</p>

Saltwood was granted by the Conqueror to Hugh de Montfort, was
recovered by Lanfranc in the great <i>placitum</i> on Pennenden Heath, was
thereafter held by the Montforts from the archbishop as two knights' fees,
was so held by Henry of Essex as their successor, was seized by the Crown
upon his forfeiture, was persistently claimed by Becket, and was finally
restored to the see by Richard I.</p>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
description of the Tower by the Empress, in her charter,
as "turris Londonie cum parvo castello quod fuit Ravengeri,"
and its similar description in Stephen's charter as "turris Lond[oniæ]
cum castello quod ei subest," though at first sight
singular and obscure, are fraught, when explained, with interest
and importance in their bearing on military architecture.</p>

<p>It will be found, on reference to the charter granted to
Aubrey de Vere (p. 180), that the Empress gives him Colchester
Castle as "turrim et castellum de Colcestr[a]," a grant confirmed
by her son as that of "turrim de Colcestr[a] et castellum"
(p. 185 <i>n.</i>), and, in later days, by Henry VIII., as
"Castrum et turrim de Colcestr[a]."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_943" id="Ref_943" href="#Foot_943">[943]</a></span> Further, in the charter
to William de Beauchamp (p. 313), we find Worcester Castle
described as "castellum de Wigorn[ia] cum mota," Hereford
Castle being similarly described in the charter granted at the
same time to Miles de Gloucester as "motam Hereford cum
toto castello." Before proceeding to the inferences to be
drawn from these expressions, it may be as well to strengthen
them by other parallel examples. Taking first the case of
Colchester, we turn to a charter of Henry I., granted to his
favourite, Eudo Dapifer, at the Christmas court of 1101,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_944" id="Ref_944" href="#Foot_944">[944]</a></span> in
which Colchester Castle is similarly described:—</p>

<p class="small">"Henricus Rex Angliæ Mauricio Lond. Episcopo et Hugoni de Bochelanda
et omnibus baronibus suis Anglis et Francis de Essex salutem. Sciatis me
dedisse benigne et ad amorem concessisse Eudoni Dapifero meo Civitatem

name="Ref_945" id="Ref_945" href="#Foot_945">[945]</a></span></p>

<p>Turning to Hereford, we find its description as "mota cum
toto castello" recurring in the confirmation by Henry II. and
the recital of that confirmation by John.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_946" id="Ref_946" href="#Foot_946">[946]</a></span> There is another
example sufficiently important to deserve separate treatment.
This is that of Gloucester.</p>

<p>We find that, in 1137, "Milo constabularius Glocestrie"
granted to the canons of "Llanthony the Second"</p>

<p class="small">"Tota oblatio custodum <i>turris et castelli</i> et Baronum ibi commorantium."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_947" id="Ref_947" href="#Foot_947">[947]</a></span></p>

<p>Here again the correctness of the description is fortunately
confirmed by subsequent evidence; for John recites (April 28,
1200) a charter of his father, Henry II. (which is assigned by
Mr. Eyton to the spring of 1155), granting to Miles's son, Roger,
Earl of Hereford,</p>

<p class="small">"custodiam <i>turris Gloc' cum toto castello</i>," etc., etc.... "per eandem firmam
quam reddere solebat comes Milo pater ejus tempore H. R. avi mei;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_948" id="Ref_948" href="#Foot_948">[948]</a></span></p>

<p>while Robert of Torigny speaks, independently, of "discordia
quæ erat inter regem Anglorum Henricum et Rogerium, filium
Milonis de Gloecestria, propter <i>turrim</i> Gloecestrie."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_949" id="Ref_949" href="#Foot_949">[949]</a></span> The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">{330}</a></span>
"tower" of Gloucester is also referred to in the Pipe-Roll of
1156,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_950" id="Ref_950" href="#Foot_950">[950]</a></span> and in the Cartulary of Gloucester Abbey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_951" id="Ref_951" href="#Foot_951">[951]</a></span> The importance
of its mention lies in the fact that it establishes the
character of Gloucester Castle, and proves that what the leading
authority has written on the subject is entirely erroneous.
Mr. G. T. Clark, in his great work on our castles, refers thus
to Gloucester:—</p>

<p class="small">"The castle of Gloucester ... was the base of all extended operations in
South Wales. Here the kings of England often held their court, and here
their troops were mustered. Brichtric had a castle at Gloucester, <i>but his
mound has long been removed, and with it all traces of the Norman building</i>."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_952" id="Ref_952" href="#Foot_952">[952]</a></span></p>

<p>In another place he goes further still:—</p>

<p class="small">"Gloucester, a royal castle, stood on the Severn bank, at one angle of the
Roman city. <i>It had a mound and a shell-keep, now utterly levelled</i>, and the
site partially built over. It was the muster-place and starting-point for
expeditions against South Wales, and the not infrequent residence of the
Norman sovereigns."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_953" id="Ref_953" href="#Foot_953">[953]</a></span></p>

<p>It may seem rash, in the teeth of these assertions, to maintain
that this mound and its shell-keep are alike imaginary, but
the word "turris" proves the fact. For, as Mr. Clark himself
observes with perfect truth,</p>

<p class="small">"in the convention between Stephen and Henry of Anjou (1153) the distinction
is drawn between '<i>Turris</i> Londinensis et <i>Mota</i> de Windesorâ,' London
having a square keep or tower, and Windsor a shell-keep upon a mound."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_954" id="Ref_954" href="#Foot_954">[954]</a></span></p>

<p>So the keep of Gloucester, being a "turris" and not a
"mota," was clearly "a square tower" and not "a shell-keep
upon a mound." The fact is that Mr. Clark's assertions would
seem to be a guess based on the hypothesis, itself (as could be
shown) untenable, that "Brichtric had a castle at Gloucester."
Assuming from this the existence of a mound, he must further
have assumed that the Normans had crowned it, as elsewhere,
with a shell-keep. But the true character of this great fortress
is now determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">{331}</a></span>
Two examples of the double style shall now be adduced
from castles outside England. In Normandy we have an entry,
in 1180, referring to expenditure "in operationibus domorum
<i>turris et castri</i>," etc., at Caen;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_955" id="Ref_955" href="#Foot_955">[955]</a></span> in Ireland the grant of Dublin
Castle to Hugh de Laci (1172) is thus related in the so-called
poem of Matthew Regan (ll. 2713-2716):—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote1">"Li riche rei ad dune baillé</div>
<div class="verse">Dyvelin en garde la cité</div>
<div class="verse"><i>E la chastel e le dongun</i></div>
<div class="verse">A Huge de Laci le barun."</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The phrase, it will be seen, corresponds exactly with those
employed to describe the castles of Carlisle and Appleby, at the
same period:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

<div class="verse quote1">"Mès voist au rei Henri, si face sa clamur</div>
<div class="verse">Que jo tieng Carduil, <i>le chastel e la tur</i>."</div>
<div class="verse quote1">"Li reis out ubblié par itant sa dolur</div>
<div class="verse">Quant avait Appelbi, <i>le chastel e la tur</i>."<span
     class="fnanchor"><a name="Ref_956" id="Ref_956" href="#Foot_956">[956]</a></span></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Having thus established the use of the phrase, let us now
pass to its origin.</p>

<p>I would urge that it possesses the peculiar value of a genuine
transition form. It preserves for us, as such, the essential fact
that there went to the making of the mediæval "castle" two
distinct factors, two factors which coalesced so early that the
original distinction between them was already being rapidly
forgotten, and is only to be detected in the faint echoes of this
"transition form."</p>

<p>The two factors to which I refer were the Roman <i>castrum</i>
or <i>castellum</i> and the mediæval "motte" or "tour." The former
survived in the <i>fortified enclosure</i>; the latter, in the <i>central keep</i>.
The Latin word <i>castellum</i> (corresponding with the Welsh <i>caer</i>)
continued to be regularly used as descriptive of a fortified
enclosure, whether surrounded by walls or earthworks.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_957" id="Ref_957" href="#Foot_957">[957]</a></span> It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">{332}</a></span>
singular how much confusion has resulted from the overlooking
of this simple fact and the retrospective application of
the denotation of the later "castle." Thus Theodore, in the
seventh century, styles the Bishop of Rochester, "Episcopus
<i>Castelli</i> Cantuariorum, <i>quod dicitur Hrofesceaster</i>" (<i>Bæda</i>, iv. 5);
and Mr. Clark gives several instances, from the eighth and
ninth centuries, in which Rochester is alternatively styled a
"civitas" and a "castellum."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_958" id="Ref_958" href="#Foot_958">[958]</a></span> So again, in the ninth century,
where the chroniclers, in 876 <small>A.D.</small>, describe how "bestæl se here
into Werham," etc., Asser and Florence paraphrase the statement
by saying that the host "<i>castellum quod dicitur Werham</i> intravit."
Now, it is obvious that there could be no "castle" at Wareham
in 876, and that even if there had been, an "army" could not
have entered it. But when we bear in mind the true meaning
of "castellum," at once all is clear. As Professor Freeman
observes, "Wareham is a fortified town."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_959" id="Ref_959" href="#Foot_959">[959]</a></span> Its famous and
ancient defences are thus described by Mr. Clark:—</p>

<p class="small">"In figure the town is nearly square, the west face about 600 yards, the
north face 650 yards.... The outline of this rectangular figure is an earthwork,
within which the town was built."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_960" id="Ref_960" href="#Foot_960">[960]</a></span></p>

<p>Such then was the nature of the "castellum," within which
the host took shelter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_961" id="Ref_961" href="#Foot_961">[961]</a></span> Passing now to a different instance, we
find the Greek κώμη ("a village") represented by "castellum"
in the Latin Gospels (Matt. xxi. 2), and this actually Englished
as "castel" in the English Gospels of 1000 <small>A.D.</small><span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_962" id="Ref_962" href="#Foot_962">[962]</a></span> Here again,
confusion has resulted from a misunderstanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">{333}</a></span>
As against the <i>castellum</i>, the fortified enclosure, we have a
new and distinct type of fortress, the outcome of a different
state of society, in the single "motte" or "tour." I shall not
here enter into the controversy as to the relation between these
two forms, my space being too limited. For the present, we
need only consider the "motte" (<i>mota</i>) as a mound (<i>agger</i>)
crowned by a stronghold (whether of timber or masonry), but
<i>not</i>, as Mr. Clark has clearly shown, "crowned with the square
donjon," as so strangely imagined by Mr. Freeman.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_963" id="Ref_963" href="#Foot_963">[963]</a></span> In the
"tour" (<i>turris</i>) we have, of course, the familiar keep of
masonry, rectangular in form, and independent of a mound.</p>

<p>The process, then, that we are about to trace is that by
which the "motte" or "tour" coalesced with the <i>castellum</i>, and
by which, from this combination, there was evolved the later
"castle." For my theory amounts to this: in the mediæval
fortress, the keep and the <i>castellum</i> were elements different in
origin, and, for a time, looked upon as distinct. It was impossible
that the compound fortress, the result of their combination,
should long retain a compound name: there must be
one name for the entire fortress, either "tour" (<i>turris</i>) or
"chastel" (<i>castellum</i>). Which was to prevail?</p>

<p>This question may have been decided by either of two considerations.
On the one hand, the relative importance of the
two factors in the fortress may have determined the ultimate
form of its style; on the other—and this, perhaps, is the more
probable explanation—the older of the two factors may have
given its name to the whole. For sometimes the keep was
added to the "castle," and sometimes the "castle" to the keep.
The former development is the more familiar, and three striking
instances in point will occur below. For the present I will
only quote a passage from Robert de Torigny, to whom we are
specially indebted for evidence on military architecture:—</p>

<p class="small">(1123) "Henricus rex ... turrem nihilominus excelsam fecit in castello
Cadomensi, et murum ipsius castelli, quem pater suus fecerat, in altum
crevit.... Item castellum quod vocatur Archas, turre et mœnibus mirabiliter
firmavit.... Turrem Vernonis similiter fecit."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_964" id="Ref_964" href="#Foot_964">[964]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">{334}</a></span>
More interesting for us is the other case, that in which the
"castle" was added to the keep, because it is that of the
respective strongholds in the capitals of Normandy and of
England. The "Tower of Rouen" and the "Tower of London"—for
such were their well-known names—were both older than
their surrounding wards (<i>castra</i> or <i>castella</i>). William Rufus
built a wall "circa turrim Londoniæ" (<i>Henry of Huntingdon</i>):<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_965" id="Ref_965" href="#Foot_965">[965]</a></span>
his brother and successor built a wall "circa turrim Rothomagi."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_966" id="Ref_966" href="#Foot_966">[966]</a></span>
The former enclosed what is now known as "the
Inner Ward" of the Tower,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_967" id="Ref_967" href="#Foot_967">[967]</a></span> the "parvum castellum" of
Maud's charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_968" id="Ref_968" href="#Foot_968">[968]</a></span></p>

<p>Of "the Tower of Rouen" I could say much. Perhaps
its earliest undoubted mention is in or about 1078 (the exact
date is doubtful), when Robert "Courthose," revolting from
his father "Rotomagum expetiit, et <i>arcem regiam</i> furtim præoccupare
sategit. Verum Rogerius de Iberico ... qui turrim
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">{335}</a></span>
custodiebat ... diligenter arcem præmunivit," Ordericus here,
as often, using <i>turris</i> and <i>arx</i> interchangeably.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_969" id="Ref_969" href="#Foot_969">[969]</a></span> Passing over
other notices of this stronghold, we come in 1090 to one of
those tragic deeds by which its history was destined to be
stained.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_970" id="Ref_970" href="#Foot_970">[970]</a></span> Mr. Freeman has told the tale of Conan's attempt
and doom.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_971" id="Ref_971" href="#Foot_971">[971]</a></span> The duke, who was occupying the Tower, left it
at the height of the struggle,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_972" id="Ref_972" href="#Foot_972">[972]</a></span> but on the triumph of his party,

for his prey and was led by him to an upper story of the Tower.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_973" id="Ref_973" href="#Foot_973">[973]</a></span>
At this point I pause to discuss the actual scene of the tragedy.
Mr. Freeman writes as follows:—</p>

<p class="small">"Conan himself was led into the castle, and there Henry took him....

<p>Here the writer misses the whole point of the topography.
The scene of Conan's death was no mere "tower of the castle,"
but "<i>the</i> Tower," the Tower of Rouen—<i>Rotomagensis turris</i>, as
William here terms it. He fails to realize that the Tower of
Rouen held a similar position to the Tower of London. Thus,
in 1098, when Helias of Le Mans was taken prisoner, we
read that "Rotomagum usque productus, in arce ipsius civitatis
in vincula conjectus est" (<i>Vetera Analecta</i>), which Wace
renders:—</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">{336}</a></span>
Again, even in the next reign, a royal charter, assigned by
Mr. Eyton to 1114-15, is tested, not at the "castle" of
Rouen, but "in <i>turre</i> Rothomagensi."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_975" id="Ref_975" href="#Foot_975">[975]</a></span> And so, two reigns
after that, a century later than Conan's death, we find the
<i>custodes</i> of "the Tower of Rouen" entered in the Exchequer
Rolls, where it is repeatedly styled "turris."</p>

<p>Thus at Rouen, as at London, the "Tower" not only preserved
its name, but ultimately imposed it on the whole fortress.
And precisely as the Tower of London is mentioned in 1141
by the transition style of "turris Londoniæ cum castello," so in
1146 we find Duke Geoffrey repairing "sartatecta turris Rothomagensis
et castelli," after it fell into his hands.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_976" id="Ref_976" href="#Foot_976">[976]</a></span></p>

<p>Here then we have at length the explanation of a difficulty
often raised. Why is "the Tower of London" so styled?<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_977" id="Ref_977" href="#Foot_977">[977]</a></span>
And although, in England, the style may now be unique, men
spoke in the days of which I write of the "Tower" of Bristol
or of Rochester as of the Tower of Gloucester.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_978" id="Ref_978" href="#Foot_978">[978]</a></span> Abroad,
the form was more persistent, and special attention may be
drawn to the Tower of Le Mans ("Turris Cenomannica),"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_979" id="Ref_979" href="#Foot_979">[979]</a></span>
because the expression "regia turris" which Ordericus applies
to it is precisely that which Florence of Worcester applies, in
1114, to the Tower of London, to which it bore an affinity in
its relation to the Roman Wall.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_980" id="Ref_980" href="#Foot_980">[980]</a></span></p>

<p>All that I have said of the "turris" keep is applicable to
the "mota" also, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, for the <i>motte</i>, though its
name was occasionally extended to the whole fortress, was
essentially the actual keep, the crowned mound, as is well
brought out in the passages quoted by Mr. Clark from French
charters:—</p>

<p class="small">"Le motte <i>et les fossez d'entour</i> ... le motte de Maiex ... le motte de
mon manoir de Caieux <i>et les fossez d'entour</i>."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_981" id="Ref_981" href="#Foot_981">[981]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">{337}</a></span>
Here the "fossez d'entour" represent the surrounding works,
the "castellum" referred to in the charters of the Empress.
But between "the right to hold a moot there," "the moat
(<i>sic</i>) and castle" as Mr. Hallam rendered it, "the moat (<i>sic</i>)
probably the <i>motte</i>" of Mr. Clark (ii. 112), and the clever
evasion "mote" in the <i>Reports on the Dignity of a Peer</i> (<i>Third
Report</i>, p. 163), the unfortunate "mota" of Hereford has had
a singular fate.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">And now for the results of those conclusions that I have
here endeavoured to set forth. The three castles to which I
shall apply them are those of Rochester, of Newcastle, and of
Arques.</p>

<p>In an elaborate article on the keep of Rochester, Mr.
Hartshorne showed that it was erected, not as was believed
by Gundulf, but by Archbishop William of Corbeuil,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_982" id="Ref_982" href="#Foot_982">[982]</a></span> between
1126 and 1139. But he did not attempt to explain what was
the "castle of stone" which Gundulf is recorded to have there
constructed. As everything turns on the exact wording, I here
give the relevant portions of the document in point: —</p>

<p class="small">"Quomodo Willelmus Rex filius Willelmi Regis rogatu Lanfranci Archiepiscopi
concessit et confirmavit Rofensi ecclesiæ S. Andreæ Apostoli ad
victum Monachorum manerium nomine Hedenham; quare Gundulfus Episcopus
<i>Castrum</i> Rofense <i>lapideum</i> totum de suo proprio Regi construxit.</p>

<p class="small">"Gundulfus ... illis contulit beneficium ... <i>castrum</i> etenim, quod situm
est in pulchriore parte Hrovecestræ.... Regi consuluerunt [duo amici]
quatinus ... Gundulfus, quia in opere cæmentarii plurimum sciens et
efficax erat, <i>castrum</i> sibi Hrofense <i>lapideum</i> de suo construeret.... Dixerunt
[Archiepiscopus et Episcopus] ... quotiescunque quidlibet ex infortunio
aliquo casu in <i>castro</i> illo contingeret aut infractione muri aut fissura maceriei,
id protinus ... exigeretur.... Hoc pacto coram Rege inito fecit <i>castrum</i>
Gundulfus Episcopus de suo ex integro totum, costamine, ut reor, lx librarum."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_983" id="Ref_983" href="#Foot_983">[983]</a></span></p>

<p>Though <i>castrum</i> is the term used throughout, Mr. Parker
in his essay on <i>The Buildings of Gundulph</i>, 1863, assumed that
a <i>tower</i> must be meant, and wrote of "Gundulf's tower" in
the Cathedral: "This is probably the tower which Gundulph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">{338}</a></span>
is recorded to have built at the cost of £60."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_984" id="Ref_984" href="#Foot_984">[984]</a></span> So too, Mr.
Clark wrote:—</p>

<p class="small">"As to his architectural skill and his work at Rochester Castle, ... the
bishop [was] to employ his skill, and spend £60 in building a castle, <i>that is,
a tower</i> of some sort. What Gundulf certainly built is the tower which still
bears his name.... It may be that Gundulf's tower was removed to make
way for the new keep, but in this case its materials would have been made
use of, and some trace of them would be almost certain to be detected. But
there is no such trace, so that probably the new keep did not supersede the
other tower."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_985" id="Ref_985" href="#Foot_985">[985]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Freeman guardedly observes:—</p>

<p class="small">"The noble tower raised in the next age by Archbishop Walter (<i>sic</i>) of
Corbeuil ... had perhaps not even a forerunner of its own class.</p>

<p class="small">"Mr. Hartshorne showed distinctly that the present tower of Rochester was
not built by Gundulf, but by William of Corbeuil.... But we have seen
(see <i>N. C.</i>, vol. iv. p. 366) that Gundulf did build a stone castle at Rochester
for William Rufus ('castrum Hrofense lapidum' [<i>sic</i>]), and we should most
naturally look for it on the site of the later one. On the other hand, there
is a tower seemingly of Gundulf's building and of a military rather than an
ecclesiastical look, which is now almost swallowed up between the transepts
of the cathedral. But it would be strange if a tower built for the king stood
in the middle of the monastic precinct."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_986" id="Ref_986" href="#Foot_986">[986]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the problem is left unsolved by all four writers.
But the true interpretation of <i>castrum</i>, as established by me
above, solves it at once. For just as William of Corbeuil is
recorded to have built the "turris" or rectangular keep,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_987" id="Ref_987" href="#Foot_987">[987]</a></span> so
Gundulf is described as constructing the <i>castrum</i> or fortified
enclosure.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_988" id="Ref_988" href="#Foot_988">[988]</a></span> We must look, therefore, for his work in the wall
that girt it round. And there we find it. Mr. Clark himself
is witness to the fact:—</p>

<p class="small">"Part of the curtain of the <i>enceinte</i> of Rochester Castle may also be Gundulph's
work. The south wall looks very early, as does the east wall."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_989" id="Ref_989" href="#Foot_989">[989]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mr. Irvine had already, in 1874, pointed out, in a brief
but valuable communication, that a distinctive peculiarity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">{339}</a></span>
Gundulf's work—the absence of plinth to his buttresses—is
found "in the castle wall at Rochester (also his)."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_990" id="Ref_990" href="#Foot_990">[990]</a></span> Thus,
it will be seen, the character of the work independently confirms
my own conclusion.</p>

<p>Some confusion, it may be well to add, has been caused by
such forms as "castellum Hrofi" and "castrum quod nominatur
Hrofesceaster." In these early forms (as in some other cases),
"castrum" denotes the whole of Rochester, girt by its Roman
wall, and not (as Mr. Hartshorne assumed throughout) the
castle enclosure. Mr. Clark leaves the point in doubt.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_991" id="Ref_991" href="#Foot_991">[991]</a></span></p>

<p>Before leaving Rochester, I would point out that, unlike the
rest of Gundulf's work, this <i>castrum</i> can be closely dated. The
conjunction of Lanfranc and William Rufus, in the story of its
building, limits it to September, 1087-March, 1089, while Odo's
rebellion would probably postpone its construction till his
surrender. It is most unfortunate, therefore, that Mr. Clark
should write, "This transaction between the bishop and the
king occurred about 1076,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_992" id="Ref_992" href="#Foot_992">[992]</a></span> when neither Gundulf was
bishop nor William king.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">To the case of Newcastle and its keep, I invite special
attention, because we have here the tacit admission of Mr.
Clark himself that he has antedated, incredible though it may
seem, by more than ninety years the erection of this famous
keep. To prove this, it is only necessary to print his own
conclusions side by side:—</p>

<p>The origin, of course, of the astounding error by which "the
great master of military architecture" misdated this keep by
nearly a century,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_993" id="Ref_993" href="#Foot_993">[993]</a></span> and took an essentially late work for one of
the earliest in existence, was the same fatal delusion that
<i>castrum</i> or <i>castellum</i> meant precisely what it did not mean,
namely, a tower. "Castellum novum super flumen Tyne
condidit" is the expression applied to Robert's work in 1080,
and the absence of a "tower" explains the fact that Fantosme
makes no mention of a "tur" when describing "Le Noef
Chasteau sur Tyne," the existing keep not being available at
the time of which he wrote.</p>

<p class="gap-above2">We now come to our last case, that of the Château d'Arques.</p>

<p>"Arques," writes Mr. Clark, "is one of the earliest examples
of a Norman castle."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_994" id="Ref_994" href="#Foot_994">[994]</a></span> It is, Mr. Freeman holds, "a fortress
which is undoubtedly one of the earliest and most important
in the history of Norman military architecture."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_995" id="Ref_995" href="#Foot_995">[995]</a></span> No apology,
therefore, is needed for discussing the date of this celebrated
structure, so long a subject of interest and of study both to
English and to French archæologists.</p>

<p>As at Colchester and in other places, the very wildest theories
have been generally advanced, and archæologists have only
gradually sobered down till they have virtually agreed upon
a date for this keep which is actually, I venture to think, less
than a century wrong.</p>

<p>In his noble monograph upon the fortress, the basis of all
subsequent accounts,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_996" id="Ref_996" href="#Foot_996">[996]</a></span> M. Deville enumerates, with contemptuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">{341}</a></span>
amusement (pp. 49, 268-272), the rival theories that it was
built (1) by the Romans; (2) by "Clotaire I." in 553—the date
1553 on one of the additions for the structure having actually
been so read; (3) by "Charles Martel" in 745, 747, or 749 (on
the strength of another reading of the same date, confirmed by
a carving of his coat-of-arms)—these being the dates given by
Houard and Toussaint-Duplessis. At the time when Deville
himself wrote the study of castles was still in its infancy, and
of the two sources of evidence now open to us, the internal
(that of the structure itself) and the external (that of chronicles
and records), the latter alone was ripe for use. Now, at
Arques, precisely as at our own Rochester, the written evidence
has hitherto appeared conflicting to archæologists, but only
because the language employed has never yet been rightly
understood. On the one hand we read in William of Jumièges,
an excellent authority in the matter, that "Hic Willelmus
[the Conqueror's uncle] castrum Archarum in cacumine ipsius
montis condidit;" and in the <i>Chronicle of Fontenelle</i>, that this
same William "Arcas castrum in pago Tellau primus statuit;"
also, in William of Poitiers, that "id munimentum ... ipse
primus fundavit:" on the other, we read in Robert du Mont, a
first-rate and contemporary authority, who may indeed be
termed a specialist on the subject, that "Anno MCXXIII.
castellum quod vocatur Archas turre et mœnibus mirabiliter
firmavit [Rex Henricus]."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_997" id="Ref_997" href="#Foot_997">[997]</a></span></p>

<p>M. de Caumont, that industrious pioneer, whose work
appeared four years before that of M. Deville, boldly followed
Robert du Mont, and confidently assigned the existing keep to
1123.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_998" id="Ref_998" href="#Foot_998">[998]</a></span> Guided, however, by M. Le Prévost (1824), he held that
the original structure was raised by the Conqueror's uncle, and
that Henry I. merely "fit <i>re</i>construire en entier le donjon et
une partie des murs d'enceinte." M. Deville, on the contrary,
in his eager zeal for the honour and glory of the castle, stoutly
maintained that, keep and all, it was clearly Count William's
work. He admitted that his Norman brother-antiquaries assigned
it to Henry I., but urged that they had overlooked the
evidence of the structure, and its resemblance to English keeps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">{342}</a></span>
assigned (but, as we now know, wrongly) to the eleventh
century, or earlier;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_999" id="Ref_999" href="#Foot_999">[999]</a></span> and that they had misunderstood the
passage in Robert du Mont, which must have referred to mere
alterations. In order thus to explain it away, he contends
(and this contention Mr. Clark strangely accepts) that Robert
says the same—which he does not—of "Gisors, Falaise, and
other castles known"—which they are not<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1000" id="Ref_1000" href="#Foot_1000">[1000]</a></span>—"to be of earlier
date" (<i>M. M. A.</i>, i. 194). Lastly, he appeals, though with an
apology for doing so ("s'il nous était permis d'invoquer à
l'appui de notre opinion"), to the far later "Chronique de
Normandie" for actual evidence, elsewhere wanting, that the
keep itself (<i>turris</i>) was built by William of Arques,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1001" id="Ref_1001" href="#Foot_1001">[1001]</a></span> that is, in
1039-1043.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1002" id="Ref_1002" href="#Foot_1002">[1002]</a></span></p>

<p>"I went over the castle minutely," Professor Freeman
writes, "in May, 1868, with M. Deville's book in hand, and can
bear witness to the accuracy of his description, though I cannot
always accept his inferences" (<i>N. C.</i>, iii. 124, <i>note</i>). He accordingly
doubts M. Deville's date for the gateway and walls of the
inner ward, but sees "no reason to doubt that the ruined keep
is part of the original work" (<i>ibid.</i>). We must remember, however,
that the Professor is at direct variance with Mr. Clark on
the Norman rectangular keeps, for which he claims an earlier
origin than the latter can concede.</p>

<p>Turning now to Mr. Clark himself, we learn from him
that—</p>

<p class="small">"it seems probable that the keep is the oldest part of the masonry, and the
work of the Conqueror's uncle, Guillaume d'Arques, and it is supposed to be
one of the earliest, if not the earliest, of the rectangular keeps known"
(<i>M. M. A.</i>, i. 194).</p>

<p>He adds that the passage in Robert du Mont</p>

<p class="small">"has been held to show that the whole structure was the work of Henry,
who reigned from 1105 (<i>sic</i>) to 1135, and the extreme boldness of the
buttresses and superincumbent constructions of the keep no doubt favour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">{343}</a></span>
this view; but, as M. Deville remarks in the same passage, similar reference
is made to Gisors, Falaise, and other castles, known to be of earlier
date" (<i>ibid.</i>).</p>

<p>To resume. The external or written evidence is as follows.
On the one hand, we have the clear and positive statement of
a contemporary writer, Robert du Mont, that Henry I. built
this keep in 1123. On the other, we have no statement from
any contemporary that it was built by William of Arques (in
1039-1043). He is merely credited with founding the <i>castellum</i>,
and in none of the contemporary accounts of its blockade and
capture by his nephew is there any mention of a <i>turris</i>. The
distinction between a <i>castellum</i> and a <i>turris</i>, with their respective
independence, has not, as I have shown, hitherto been realized,
and it is quite in the spirit of older students that M. Deville
confidently exclaims—</p>

<p class="small">"Or, conçoit-on un château-fort sans murailles? Un château-fort sans
donjon, dans le cours du XIVᵉ siècle, en Normandie, n'est guère plus rationnel"
(p. 310).</p>

<p>As to the "murailles," Mr. Clark has taught us that palisades
were not replaced by walls till a good deal later than has been
usually supposed; and as to the "donjon," if, as I have established,
so important a fortress as Rochester was without a keep
in the eleventh, and indeed well into the twelfth century, other
<i>castella</i> must have been similarly destitute—probably, for
instance, Newcastle, as we have seen, and certainly Exeter,
of which Mr. Clark writes: "There is no evidence of a keep,
nor, at so great a height, was any needed" (<i>M. M. A.</i>, ii. 47).
The same argument from strength of position would <i>à fortiori</i>
apply to Arques, and there is, in short, no reason for doubting
that the <i>castrum</i> of William of Arques need not have included
a <i>turris</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1003" id="Ref_1003" href="#Foot_1003">[1003]</a></span></p>

<p>On what, then, rests the assertion that the keep was the
work of the Conqueror's uncle? Strange as it may seem, it
rests solely on the so-called <i>Chronique de Normandie</i>, an anonymous
production, not of the eleventh, but of the fourteenth
century! "Si fist faire une tour moult forte audessus du
chastel d'Arques," runs the passage, which is quoted by Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">{344}</a></span>
Clark (i. 194), from Deville (pp. 311, 312), who, however,
apologized for appealing to that authority. This "Chronique"
is admitted to have been based on the poetical histories of Wace
and Benoit de St. More, themselves written several generations
later than the alleged erection of this keep. Of the former,
Mr. Freeman holds that, except where repeating contemporary
authorities, "his statements need to be very carefully weighed"
(<i>N. C.</i>, ii. 162); and of the latter, that he is "of much smaller
historical authority" (<i>ibid.</i>). To this I may add that, in my
opinion, Wace, writing as he did in the reign of Henry II., at
the close of the great tower-building epoch, spoke loosely
of towers, when mentioning castles, as if they had been equally
common in the reign of the Conqueror. A careful inspection
of his poem will be found to verify this statement. "La tur
d'Arques" was standing when he wrote: consequently he
talks of "La tur d'Arques" when describing the Conqueror's
blockade of the castle in 1053. There is no contemporary
authority for its existence at that date.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1004" id="Ref_1004" href="#Foot_1004">[1004]</a></span></p>

<p>And now let us pass from documentary evidence to that of
the structure itself. We may call Mr. Clark himself to witness
that the presumption is against so early a date as 1039-1043.
He tells us, of the rectangular keep in general, that—</p>

<p class="small">"not above half a dozen examples can be shown with certainty to have been
constructed in Normandy before the latter part of the eleventh century, and
but very few, if any, before the English conquest" (i. 35).</p>

<p>Therefore, on Mr. Clark's own showing, we ought to ask for
conclusive evidence before admitting that any rectangular keep
is as old as 1039-1043. But what was the impression produced
on him by an inspection of the structure itself? This is a most
significant fact. While rejecting, apparently on what he believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">{345}</a></span>
to be documentary evidence, the theory that the keep
(<i>turris</i>) was the work of Henry I., he confessed that the features
of the building "no doubt favour this view" (i. 194, <i>ut supra</i>).</p>

<p>But leaving, for the present, Mr. Clark's views, to which
I shall return below, I take my stand without hesitation on
certain features in this keep. It is not needful to visit Arques—I
have myself never done so—to appreciate their true significance
and their bearing on the question of the date. The first
of these is the forebuilding. Mr. Clark tells us that Arques
possesses "the usual square appendage or forebuilding common
in these keeps" (<i>M. M. A.</i>, i. 198). But this unscientific treatment
of the forebuilding, ignoring so completely its origin and
development, cannot too strongly be resisted. Restricting
ourselves to the case before us, we at once observe the peculiarity
of an external staircase, not only leading up to a forebuilding,
through which the keep is entered, but actually
carried, through a massive buttress, round an angle of the keep.<span class="fnanchor"><a

Rochester being believed to be the work of Gundulf, in the days
when M. Deville wrote, it was natural that he should have
supposed "cette savante combinaison" to have been familiar
to Gundulf (p. 299). But now that, on these points, we are
better informed, let us ask where can Mr. Clark produce an
instance of this elaborate and striking device as old even as the
days of Gundulf, to say nothing of those of Count William
(1039-1043)? Where we do find it is in such keeps as Dover,
the work of Henry II., or Rochester, where the resemblance is
even more remarkable. Now, Rochester, as we know, was
actually built within a few years of the date given by Robert
du Mont, and upheld by me, as that of the construction of
Arques. Oddly enough, it is Mr. Clark himself who thus points
out another resemblance:—</p>

<p class="small">"In the basement of the forebuilding ... was a vaulted chamber, opening
into the basement of the keep, <i>as at Rochester</i>, either a store or prison"
(<i>M. M. A.</i>, p. 188).</p>

<p>Lastly, both at Arques and at Rochester, we find on the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">{346}</a></span>
floor, near the entrance, the very peculiar feature of a smaller
doorway communicating with the rampart of the curtain.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1006" id="Ref_1006" href="#Foot_1006">[1006]</a></span> This
parallel, which is not alluded to by Mr. Clark, is the more
remarkable, as such a device is foreign to the earlier rectangular
keeps, and also implies that the keep must have been built
certainly no earlier, and possibly later, than the curtain, which
curtain, Mr. Clark, as we shall find, admits, cannot be so old as
the days of Count William.</p>

<p>No one, in short, unbiassed by supposed documentary
evidence, could study this keep, with its "petites galeries avec
d'autres petites chambres ou prisons pratiquées dans l'épaisseur
des murs"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1007" id="Ref_1007" href="#Foot_1007">[1007]</a></span> (as at Rochester), with the elaborate defences of
its entrance, and with those other special features which made
even Mr. Clark uneasy, without rejecting as incredible the
accepted view that it was built by Count William of Arques
(1039-1043). And this being so, there is, admittedly, no
alternative left but to assign it to Henry I. (1123), the date
specifically given by Robert du Mont himself.</p>

<p>But, it may be urged, though there is nothing improbable
in Mr. Freeman being wrong, is it conceivable that so unrivalled
an expert as Mr. Clark himself can have mistaken a keep of
1123 for one of 1039-1043, when we remember the wonderful
development of these structures in the course of those eighty
years? To this objection, I fear, there is a singularly complete
answer in the case of Newcastle, where, as we have seen, he
was led by the same misconception into no less amazing an
error.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1008" id="Ref_1008" href="#Foot_1008">[1008]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, the view I have brought forward as to the separate
existence of "tower" and "castle" may be said, from these
examples, to revolutionize the study of Norman military
architecture.</p>

value for its evidence on the Clare pedigree, Gilbert, Robert, and Richard,
the witnesses, being all grandsons of Count Gilbert, the progenitor of the
house. Among the documents in the <i>Monasticon</i> relating to Bec, we find
mention of "Emmæ uxoris Baldewini filii Comitis Gilberti et filiorum ejus
Roberti et Ricardi," which singularly confirms the accuracy of this charter
and its list of witnesses. This is worth noting, because the charter is
curious in form, and has been described as having "a suspicious ring." It is
also found in (Morant's) transcript of the Colchester cartulary (<i>Stowe MSS.</i>).</p>

There is a strange use of "castellum," apparently in this sense, in
William of Malmesbury's version (ii. 119) of Godwine's speech on the Dover
riot (1051). The phrase is "magnates <i>illius castelli</i>," which Mr. Freeman
unhesitatingly renders "the magistrates of that <i>town</i>" (<i>Norm. Conq.</i>, 2nd ed.,
ii. 135), a rendering which should be compared with his remarks on "castles"
on the next page but one, and in Appendix S. Mr. Clark is of opinion that
"whether 'castellum' can [here] be taken for more than the fortified town
is uncertain" (<i>M. M. A.</i>, ii. 8).</p>

Freeman asserts (<i>Norm. Conq.</i>, 2nd ed., ii. 137), or to imply that it then first
appeared in the language.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_967" id="Foot_967" href="#Ref_967">[967]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
I can make nothing of Mr. Clark's chronology. In his description of
the Tower he first tells us that "all save the keep [<i>i.e.</i> the White Tower] is
later, and most of it considerably later than the eleventh century" (<i>M. M. A.</i>,
ii. 205), and then that "the Tower of the close of the reign of Rufus" (i.e.
<i>before the end of</i> "the eleventh century") ... was probably composed of the
White Tower with a palace ward upon its south-east side, and a wall, probably
that we now see, and certainly along its general course, including what is
now known as the inner ward" (<i>ibid.</i>, ii. 253). Again, as to the Wakefield
Tower, which "deserves very close attention, its lower story being next to
the keep in antiquity" (<i>ibid.</i>, ii. 220), Mr. Clark tells us that Gundulf (who
died in 1108) was the founder "perhaps of the Wakefield Tower" (<i>ibid.</i>, ii.
252); nay, that "Devereux Tower ... may be as old as Wakefield, and
therefore in substance <i>the work of Rufus</i>" (<i>ibid.</i>, ii. 253); and yet we learn
of this same basement, that "the basement of Wakefield Tower is probably
late Norman, perhaps of the reign of Stephen or Henry II., although this is
no doubt early for masonry so finely jointed" (<i>ibid.</i>, ii. 224). In other words,
a structure which was "the work of Rufus," <i>i.e.</i> of 1087-1100, can only be
attributed, at the very earliest, to the days of "Stephen or Henry II.," <i>i.e.</i>
to 1135-1189.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_968" id="Foot_968" href="#Ref_968">[968]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The very same phrase is employed by Robert de Torigny in describing
her husband's action at Torigny ten years later (1151): "dux obsederat
castellum Torinneium, sed propter adventum Regis infecto negotio discesserat;
combustis tamen domibus infra muros usque ad turrem et <i>parvum
castellum circa eam</i>" (ed. Howlett, p. 161).</p>

A curious touch in a legend of the time brings before us in a vivid
manner the impression that this mighty tower had made upon the Norman
mind. Hugh de Glos, an oppressor of the poor, appearing, after death, to a
priest by night (1090), declared that the burden he was compelled to bear
seemed "heavier to carry than the Tower of Rouen" ("Ecce candens
ferrum molendini gesto in ore, quod sine dubio mihi videtur ad ferendum
gravius Rotomagensi arce."—<i>Ord. Vit.</i>, iii. 373).</p>

'not a single horse is equipped in steel armour; and if we refer to the
authors who lived at that period, we shall find that not one of them mentions
any defensive covering for the horse.'" Compare also the expression of
William of Malmesbury, who lived and wrote under the tower-building king,
that the Norman barons took advantage of the Conqueror's minority "<i>turres</i>
agere," these being the structures with the building of which the writer was
most familiar.</p>

<p>The cardinal error has been the supposition that when the
citizens of London, under Henry I., were given Middlesex <i>ad firmam</i>,
the "Middlesex" in question was only Middlesex <i>exclusive
of London</i>. The actual words of the charter are these:—</p>

<p class="small">"Sciatis me concessisse civibus meis London[iarum], tenendum Middlesex
ad firmam pro ccc libris ad compotum, ipsis et hæredibus suis de me et
hæredibus meis ita quod ipsi cives ponent vicecomitem qualem voluerint de
se ipsis; et justitiarium qualem voluerint de se ipsis, ad custodiendum
placita coronæ meæ et eadem placitanda, et nullus alius erit justitiarius
super ipsos homines London[iarum]."</p>

<p class="nodent">Now, it is absolutely certain that the shrievalty (<i>vicecomitatus</i>)
and the ferm (<i>firma</i>) mentioned in this passage are the
shrievalty and the ferm not of Middlesex apart from London,
nor of London apart from Middlesex, but of "London <i>and</i>
Middlesex." For there is never, from the first, but one ferm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">{348}</a></span>
It is here called the ferm of "Middlesex;" in the almost contemporary
Pipe-Roll (31 Hen. I.) it is called the ferm of
"London" (there being no ferm of Middlesex mentioned); and
Geoffrey's charters clinch the matter. For while Stephen
grants him "the shrievalties of London and Middlesex,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1010" id="Ref_1010" href="#Foot_1010">[1010]</a></span> the
Empress, in her turn, grants him "the shrievalty of London and
Middlesex."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1011" id="Ref_1011" href="#Foot_1011">[1011]</a></span> Further, the Pipe-Rolls of Henry II. describe this
same <i>firma</i> both as the ferm of "London," and as that of "London
and Middlesex;" while in the Roll of 8 Ric. I. we find the
phrase, "de veteri firma <i>Comitat'</i> Lond' et Middelsexa." Lastly,
the charter of Henry III. grants to the citizens of London—</p>

<p class="small">"Vicecomitatum Londoniæ et de Middelsexia, cum omnibus rebus et
consuetudinibus quæ pertinent ad predictum Vicecomitatum, infra civitatem
et extra per terras et aquas; ... Reddendo inde annuatim ... trescentas
libras sterlingorum blancorum.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1012" id="Ref_1012" href="#Foot_1012">[1012]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">And so, to this day, the shrievalty is that of "London and
Middlesex."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1013" id="Ref_1013" href="#Foot_1013">[1013]</a></span></p>

<p>The royal writs and charters hear the same witness. When
they are directed to the local authorities, it is to those of
"London and Middlesex," or of "London," or of "Middlesex."
The three are, for all purposes, used as equivalent terms.
There was never, as I have said, but one ferm, and never but
one shrievalty.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1014" id="Ref_1014" href="#Foot_1014">[1014]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">{349}</a></span></p>

<p>Now, this completely disposes of the view that the "Middlesex"
of Henry I.'s charter was Middlesex <i>apart from London</i>.
This prevalent but erroneous assumption has proved the cause
of much confusion and misunderstanding of the facts of the
case. It has nowhere, perhaps, been assigned such prominence
as in that account of London by Mr. Loftie which may derive
authority in the eyes of some from the editorial <i>imprimatur</i>
of Mr. Freeman.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1015" id="Ref_1015" href="#Foot_1015">[1015]</a></span> We there read as follows:—</p>

<p class="small">"It may be as well, before we proceed, to remember one thing. That
London is not in Middlesex, that it never was in Middlesex, ... is a fact
of which we have to be constantly reminded" (p. 125).</p>

<p class="nodent">From this interpretation of the "Middlesex" of the charter,
it, of course, followed that the writer took the <i>firma</i> of £300
to be paid in respect of Middlesex <i>exclusive of London</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1016" id="Ref_1016" href="#Foot_1016">[1016]</a></span> We
need not wonder, therefore, that to him the grant is difficult
to understand. Here are his comments on its terms:—</p>

<p class="small">"If we could estimate the reasons which led to this grant with any
degree of certainty, we should understand better what the citizens expected
to gain by it besides rights of jurisdiction.... The meaning and nature of
the grant are subjects of which we should like to know more. But here we
can obtain little help from books ... and we may inquire in vain for a
definition of the position and duties of the sheriff who acts for the citizens
in their subject county.... There must have been advantages to accrue
from the payment by London of £300 a year, a sum which, small as it seems
to us, was a heavy tax in those days. We may be sure the willing citizens
expected to obtain correspondingly valuable liberties" (pp. 121-123).</p>

<p class="nodent">Then follow various conjectures, all of them necessarily wide
of the mark. And as with the ferm, so with the sheriff.
Mr. Loftie, taking the sheriff (<i>vicecomes</i>) in question to be a
sheriff of Middlesex exclusive of London (which he hence
terms a "subject county"), is of necessity baffled by the charter.
For by it the citizens are empowered to appoint (<i>a</i>) a "vicecomes,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">{350}</a></span>
(<i>b</i>) a "justitiarius." As the "vicecomes," according
to his view, had nothing to do with the City itself, Mr. Loftie
has to account for "the omission of any reference to the portreeve
in the charter," his assumption being that the City itself
was at this time governed by a portreeve. Though his views
are obscurely expressed, his solutions of the problem are as
follows. In his larger work he dismisses the supposition that
the "justitiarius" of the charter was the "chief magistrate"
of the City, <i>i.e.</i> the portreeve, because the citizens must have
been "already" entitled to elect that officer. Yet in his later
work, with equal confidence, he tells us that by "justitiarius"
the portreeve is "evidently intended." The fact is that he is
really opposing two different suppositions; the one that Henry
granted by his charter the right to elect a portreeve, the other
that he did not grant it, but retained the appointment in his
hands. Mr. Loftie first denies the former, and then, in his
later work, asserts the former to deny the latter. But really
his language is so confused that it is doubtful whether he
realized himself the contradictory drift of his two arguments,
both based on the same assumption, which "it is manifestly
absurd," we learn, to dispute.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1017" id="Ref_1017" href="#Foot_1017">[1017]</a></span> And the strange part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">{351}</a></span>
business is this, What is the "proof" that Mr. Loftie offers
for the later of his two hypotheses? If the "trial" to
which he refers had ever taken place at all, and, still more,
if it had taken place before 1115, the fact would have an
important bearing. But, in the first place, he has wrongly
assigned to the record too early a date, and, in the second,
it represents Gilbert Prutfot, not as a judge, but as a culprit.
The expression used is, "Terra quam Gillebertus Prutfot nobis
disfortiat."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1018" id="Ref_1018" href="#Foot_1018">[1018]</a></span> Now "defortiare" (or "disfortiare") is rendered
by Dr. Stubbs, in his <i>Select Charters</i> (p. 518), "to deforce, to
dispossess by violence." We have here, therefore, an interesting,
because early, example of the legal offence of "deforcement,"
defined by Johnson as "a withholding of lands and
tenements by force from the right owner." But the point to
which I would call attention is that, even if this writer were
correct in his facts (which he is not), his "proof" that (a
<i>vicecomes</i> and a <i>justitiarius</i> being mentioned in the charter) the
justitiarius was "evidently" the portreeve consists in the fact
that a <i>vicecomes</i> had "given judgment" in a trial, and being
styled <i>vicecomes</i>, was the portreeve! That is to say, the <i>justitiarius</i>
must have been the portreeve <i>because</i> the portreeve
was styled (<i>not</i> "justitiarius," but, on the contrary,) <i>vicecomes</i>.
Such is actually his argument.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1019" id="Ref_1019" href="#Foot_1019">[1019]</a></span></p>

<p>I have dwelt thus fully on these observations, because they
illustrate the hopeless wandering which is the inevitable result
of the adoption of the above fundamental error.</p>

<p>We have a curiously close parallel to this use of "London
and Middlesex" in the expression "turris et castellum," on
which I have elsewhere dwelt.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1020" id="Ref_1020" href="#Foot_1020">[1020]</a></span> Just as the relative importance
of the "Tower" of London to the encircling "castle" at its
feet led to the term "turris" alone being used to describe the
two,—while, conversely, in the provinces, "castellum" was the
term adopted,—so did the relative greatness of London to
the county that lay around its walls lead to the occasional use
of "London" as a term descriptive of both together, a usage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">{352}</a></span>
impossible in the provinces. Whether a "turris et castellum"
were destined to become known as a "turris" or a "castellum,"
whether "Londonia et Middelsex" were described as
"Londonia" merely, or as "Middlesex," in each case the entity
is the same. For fiscal, and therefore for our purposes, "London
and Middlesex," under whatever name, remain one and
indivisible.</p>

<p>The special value of the charters granted to Geoffrey de
Mandeville lies not so much in their complete confirmation of
the view that the <i>firma</i> of "Middlesex" was that of "London
<i>and</i> Middlesex" (for that would be evident without them), as in
their proof of the fact, so strangely overlooked, that this connection
was at least as old as the days of William the Conqueror,
and in their treatment of Middlesex (including London) as an
ordinary county like Essex or Herts, "farmed" in precisely
the same way. The <i>firma</i> of Herts was £60, of Essex £300,
and of Middlesex (because containing London) £300 also.</p>

<p>But now let us leave our record evidence and turn to
geography and to common sense. What must have always
been the salient feature which distinguished Middlesex internally
from every other county? Obviously, that the shire was
abnormally small, and its chief town abnormally large. Nor
was it a mere matter of size, but, still more, of comparative
wealth. This is illustrated by the taxation recorded in the
Pipe-Roll of 1130. Unlike the <i>firma</i>, the taxes were raised,
as elsewhere, from the town and the shire respectively, the
town contributing an <i>auxilium</i>, and the shire, without the
walls, a Danegeld. We thus learn that London paid a sum
about half as large again as that raised from the rest of the
shire.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1021" id="Ref_1021" href="#Foot_1021">[1021]</a></span> The normal relation of the "shire" to the "port" was
accordingly here reversed, and so would be also, in consequence,
that of the shire-reeve to the portreeve. Where, as
usual, the "port" formed but a small item in the <i>corpus
comitatus</i>, it was possible to sever it from the rest of the
county, to place it <i>extra firmam</i>, and to give it a reeve who
should stand towards it in the same relation as the shire-reeve
to the shire, and would therefore be termed the "portreeve."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">{353}</a></span>
But to have done this in the case of Middlesex would
have been to reverse the nature of things, to place a mere
"portreeve" in a position greater than that of the "shire-reeve"
himself. This is why that change which, in the provinces,
was the aim of every rising town, never took place in
the case of London, though the greatest town of all. I say that
it "never took place," for, as we have seen, the city of London
was never severed from the rest of the shire. As far back as
we can trace them, they are found one and indivisible.</p>

<p>What, then, was the alternative? Simply this. The
"reeve," who, in the case of a normal county, took his title
from the "shire" and not from the "port," took it, in the
abnormal case of Middlesex, from the "port" and not from the
"shire." In each case both "port" and "shire" were alike
within his jurisdiction; in each case he took his style from
the most important part of that jurisdiction. Such is the
original solution I offer for this most interesting problem, and
I claim that its acceptance will explain everything, will harmonize
with all existing <i>data</i>, and will dispose of difficulties
which, hitherto, it has been impossible to surmount.</p>

<p>My contention is, briefly, that the Norman <i>vicecomes</i> of
"London," or "Middlesex," or "London and Middlesex"
was simply the successor, in that office, of the Anglo-Saxon
"portreeve." With the sphere of the <i>vicecomes</i> I have already
dealt, and though we are not in a position similarly to prove
the sphere of the Anglo-Saxon "portreeve," I might appeal
to the belief of Mr. Loftie himself that "Ulf the Sheriff of
Middlesex is identical with Ulf the Portreeve of London"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1022" id="Ref_1022" href="#Foot_1022">[1022]</a></span>
(though he adds, contrary to my contention, that "as yet their
official connection was only that of neighbourhood"),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1023" id="Ref_1023" href="#Foot_1023">[1023]</a></span> and
that Ansgar, though one of the "portreeves" (p. 24); "was
Sheriff of Middlesex for a time there can be no doubt"
(p. 127).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1024" id="Ref_1024" href="#Foot_1024">[1024]</a></span> But I would rather appeal to the vital fact that
the shire-reeve and the portreeve are, so far I know, never
mentioned together, and that writs are directed to a portreeve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">{354}</a></span>
or to a shire-reeve,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1025" id="Ref_1025" href="#Foot_1025">[1025]</a></span> but never to both. Specially
would I insist upon the indisputable circumstance that such
writs as were addressed to the "portreeve" by the Anglo-Saxon
kings, were addressed to the <i>vicecomes</i> by the Norman, and
that the turning-point is seen under the Conqueror himself,
whose Anglo-Saxon charter is addressed to the "bisceop" and
the "portirefan," and whose Latin writs are, similarly, addressed
to the <i>episcopus</i> and the <i>vicecomes</i>. More convincing evidence
it would not be easy to find.</p>

<p>The acceptance of this view will at once dispose of the
alleged "disappearance of the portreeve," with the difficulties
it has always presented, and the conjectures to which it has
given rise.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1026" id="Ref_1026" href="#Foot_1026">[1026]</a></span> The style of the "portreeve" indeed disappears,
but his office does not. In the person of the Norman <i>vicecomes</i>,
it preserves an unbroken existence. Geoffrey de Mandeville
steps, as sheriff, into the shoes of Ansgar the portreeve.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1027" id="Ref_1027" href="#Foot_1027">[1027]</a></span></p>

<p>The problem as to what became of the portreeve, a problem
which has exercised so many minds, sprang from the delusion
that in the Norman period the City must have had a portreeve
for governor independent of the Sheriff of Middlesex. I term
this an undoubted "delusion," because I have already made it
clear that the City was part of the sheriff's jurisdiction and contributed
its share to his <i>firma</i>. There was, therefore, no room
for an independent portreeve; nor indeed does a "portreeve"
of London, I believe, ever occur after the Conqueror's charter.</p>

<p>But we must here glance at the contrary view set forth by
Mr. Loftie:—</p>

<p class="small">"The succession of portreeves is uninterrupted. We have the names of
some of them in the records of the Exchequer. Occasionally two or three,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">{355}</a></span>
once as many as five, came to answer for the City and pay the £300 which
was the farm of Middlesex. In 1129, a few years only after the retirement of
Orgar and his companions, we read of 'quatuor vicecomites' as attending for
London. The following year we hear of a single 'camerarius.' The 'Hugh
Buche' of Stowe may be identified with the Hugo de Bock of the St. Paul's
documents, and his 'Richard de Par' with Richard the younger, the chamberlain.
'Par' is probably a misreading for Parvus contracted. In the reign
of Stephen two members of the Buckerel family hold office, and we have
Fulcred and Robert, who were related to each other. Another early portreeve
was Wluardus, who attends at the Exchequer in 1138, and who continued to
be an alderman thirty years later" (<i>Historic Towns: London</i>, p. 34).</p>

<p>Where are "the records of the Exchequer" from which
we learn all this? The only Pipe-Roll of the period is that
of 1130, in which "the farm of Middlesex" is not £300,
but a much larger sum, a fact which, as we shall find, has a
most important bearing. The "quatuor vicecomites" appear
"as attending," not in 1129, but in 1130. The "camerarius"
does not (and could not) appear "in the following year,"
but, on the contrary, belonged to a preceding one ("Willelmus
<i>qui fuit</i> camerarius de <i>veteribus</i> debitis"); nor does
he account for the <i>firma</i>. The <i>firma</i> was always accounted
for by "vicecomites," and not (as implied on p. 108) by a
chamberlain, or by a "prefect." The "Hugh Buche" is given
in Mr. Loftie's former work (p. 98) as "Hugh de Buch." He
is meant (as even Foss perceived) for the well-known Hugh de
Bocland (the minister of Henry I.), who cannot be shown to
have been a "portreeve." No "Hugo de Bock" occurs in the
St. Paul's documents, which only mention "Hugo de Bochelanda"
and "Hugo de Bock[elanda]," the latter imperfection
being the source of the error. "Richard, the younger,
chamberlain" only occurs in these documents a century later
(1204-1215), and "the younger," I presume, there translates
"juvenis," and not "parvus." It is, moreover, quite certain
that Stowe's "de Par" was not "a misreading for 'parvus'
contracted," but for "delpare," as may easily be ascertained.
No member of the Bucherel family occurs in these documents
as holding office "in the reign of Stephen," though some do in
the next century. Fulcred was not a "portreeve," but a
"chamberlain;" and Robert, Fulcred's brother, was neither
one nor the other. But what are we to say to "Wluardus"
the portreeve, "who attends at the Exchequer in 1138"?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">{356}</a></span>
Where are the "records of the Exchequer for 1138"? They
are known to Mr. Loftie alone.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1028" id="Ref_1028" href="#Foot_1028">[1028]</a></span> Moreover, his identification,
here, of the <i>vicecomes</i> with the portreeve is in direct antagonism
to the principle laid down just before (p. 29), that, on the
contrary, it was the <i>justitiarius</i> who should "evidently" be
identified with the portreeve (see p. 350, <i>supra</i>).</p>

<p>Perhaps the assumption of a portreeve's existence springs
from forgetfulness or misapprehension of the condition of
London at the time. Its corporate unity, we must always
remember, had not yet been developed. As Dr. Stubbs so truly
observes, London was only</p>

<p class="small">"a bundle of communities, townships, parishes, and lordships, of which each
has its own constitution."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1029" id="Ref_1029" href="#Foot_1029">[1029]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot indeed agree with him in his view that the result
of the charter of Henry I. was to replace this older system by
a new "shire organization."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1030" id="Ref_1030" href="#Foot_1030">[1030]</a></span> For my contention is that our
great historian not only misdates the charter in question, but
also misunderstands it (though not so seriously as others), and
that it made no difference in the "organization" at all. But
I would cordially endorse these his words:—</p>

<p class="small">"No new incorporation is bestowed: the churches, the barons, the citizens
retain their ancient customs; the churches their sokens, the barons their
manors, the citizens their township organization, and possibly their guilds.
The municipal unity which they possess is of the same sort as that of the
county and hundred."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1031" id="Ref_1031" href="#Foot_1031">[1031]</a></span></p>

<p>And he further observes that the City "clearly was organized
under a sheriff like any other shire." Thus the local government
of the day was to be found in the petty courts of these
various "communities," and not in any central corporation.
The only centralizing element was the sheriff, and his office was
not so much to "govern," as to satisfy the financial claims of
the Crown in ferm, taxes, and profits of jurisdiction. There was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">{357}</a></span>
of course, the general "folkmote" over which, with the bishop,
he would preside, but the true corporate organisms were those
of the several communities. The sheriff and the folkmote
could no more mould these self-governing bodies into one
coherent whole, than they could, or did, accomplish this in the
case of an ordinary shire. Here we have a somewhat curious
parallel between such a polity as is here described and that of
the present metropolis outside the City. There, too, we have the
local communities, with their quasi-independent vestries, etc.,
and the Metropolitan Board of Works is a substitute for their
"folkmote" or "shiremote."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1032" id="Ref_1032" href="#Foot_1032">[1032]</a></span> But, to revert to the days of
Henry I., the Anglo-Saxon system of government, its strength
varying in intension conversely with its sphere in extension,
possessed the toughest vitality in its lowest and simplest forms.
Thus the original territorial system might never have led to a
corporate unity. But what the sheriff and the folkmote could
not accomplish, the mayor and the <i>communa</i> could and did. The
territorial arrangement was overthrown by the rising power of
commerce. To quote once more from Dr. Stubbs's work:</p>

<p class="small">"The establishment of the corporate character of the City under a mayor
marks the victory of the communal principle over the more ancient shire
organization.... It also marks the triumph of the mercantile over the
aristocratic element."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1033" id="Ref_1033" href="#Foot_1033">[1033]</a></span></p>

<p>At the risk of being tedious I would now repeat the view
I have advanced on the shrievalty, because the point is of such
paramount importance that it cannot be expressed too clearly.
The great illustrative value of Geoffrey's charters is this. They
prove, in the first place, that Middlesex (inclusive of London)
was treated financially on the same footing as Essex or Herts
or any other shire; and in the second they give us that all-important
information, the amount of the <i>firma</i> for each of
these counties at the close of the eleventh century. All we
have to do in the case of Middlesex is to keep steadily in view
its <i>firma</i> of £300. Sometimes described as the <i>firma</i> of
"London," sometimes "of Middlesex," and sometimes "of
London and Middlesex," its identity never changes; it is always,
and beyond the shadow of question, the <i>firma</i> of Middlesex
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">{358}</a></span>
inclusive of London. The history of this ancient payment
reveals a persistent endeavour of the Crown to increase its
amount, an endeavour which was eventually foiled. Under the
first Geoffrey de Mandeville (William I. and William II.), it
was £300. Nearly doubled by Henry I., it was yet reduced to
£300 by his charter to the citizens of London. In the succeeding
reign, the second Geoffrey eventually secured it from both
claimants at the same low figure (£300). Under Henry II., as
the Pipe-Rolls show, it was again raised as under Henry I.
John, we shall find, reduced it again to the original £300, and
the reduction was confirmed by his successor on his assuming
the reins of power. For we find a charter of Henry III.
conceding to the citizens of London (February 11, 1227)—</p>

<p class="nodent">The adhesion of the City to Simon de Montfort resulted in the

their own who should hold the shrievalty of the City and
Middlesex as they used to have." But the <i>firma</i> was raised

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">{359}</a></span>
Edward III. (March 9, 1326/7), the <i>firma</i> was reduced to the
original sum of £300 a year, at which figure, Mr. Loftie says,
"it has remained ever since."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1035" id="Ref_1035" href="#Foot_1035">[1035]</a></span></p>

<p>This one <i>firma</i>, of which the history has here been traced,
represents one <i>corpus comitatus</i>, namely, Middlesex inclusive of
London.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1036" id="Ref_1036" href="#Foot_1036">[1036]</a></span> From this conclusion there is no escape.</p>

<p>Hence the <i>firmarii</i> of this <i>corpus comitatus</i> were from the
first the <i>firmarii</i> (that is, the sheriffs) of Middlesex inclusive of
London. This, similarly, is beyond dispute. As with the
<i>firma</i> so with the sheriffs. Whether described as "of London,"
or "of Middlesex," or "of London and Middlesex," they are,
from the first, the sheriffs of Middlesex inclusive of London.</p>

<p>This conclusion throws a new light on the charter by which
Henry I. granted to the citizens of London Middlesex (<i>i.e.</i>
Middlesex inclusive of London) at farm. Broadly speaking,
the transaction in question may be regarded in this aspect.
Instead of leasing the <i>corpus comitatus</i> to any one individual
for a year, or for a term of years, the king leased it to the
citizens as a body, leased it, moreover, in perpetuity, and at the
low original <i>firma</i> of £300 a year. The change effected was
simply that which was involved in placing the citizens, as a
body, in the shoes of the Sheriff "of London and Middlesex."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1037" id="Ref_1037" href="#Foot_1037">[1037]</a></span></p>

<p>The only distinction between this lease and one to a private
individual lies in the corporate character of the lessee, and in
the consequent provision for the election of a representative of
that corporate body: "Ita quod ipsi cives ponent vicecomites
qualem voluerint de seipsis."</p>

<p>It would seem that under the <i>régime</i> adopted by Henry I.,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">{360}</a></span>
the financial exactions of which a glimpse is afforded us in the
solitary Pipe-Roll of his reign, included the leasing of the
counties, etc. (<i>i.e.</i> of the financial rights of the Crown in them),
at the highest rate possible. This was effected either by adding
to the annual <i>firma</i>, a sum "de cremento," or by exacting from
the <i>firmarius</i>, over and above his <i>firma</i>, a payment "de gersoma"
for his lease. Where the lease was offered for open
competition it would be worth the while of the would-be
<i>firmarius</i> to offer a large payment "de gersoma" for his lease,
if the <i>firma</i> was a low one. But if the <i>firma</i> was a high one,
he would not offer much for his bargain. In the case of
Oxfordshire we find the sheriff paying no less than four hundred
marks "de gersoma, pro comitatu habendo."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1038" id="Ref_1038" href="#Foot_1038">[1038]</a></span> But in Berkshire
the payment "de gersoma" would seem to have been considerably
less.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1039" id="Ref_1039" href="#Foot_1039">[1039]</a></span> Sometimes the county (or group of counties)
was leased for a specified term of years. Thus "Maenfininus"
had taken a lease of Bucks. and Beds. for four years,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1040" id="Ref_1040" href="#Foot_1040">[1040]</a></span> for which,
seemingly, he paid but a trifling sum "de gersoma," while
William de Eynsford (Æinesford) paid a hundred marks for
a five years' lease of Essex and Herts.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1041" id="Ref_1041" href="#Foot_1041">[1041]</a></span> Now, the fact that
William de Eynsford was not an Essex but a Kentish landowner
obviously suggests that in taking this lease he was
actuated by speculative motives. It is, indeed, an admitted
fact that the Norman gentry, in their greed for gain, were by
no means above indulging in speculations of the kind. But
when we make the interesting discovery that William de Eynsford,
in this same reign, had acted as Sheriff of London,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1042" id="Ref_1042" href="#Foot_1042">[1042]</a></span> may
we not infer that, there also, he had indulged in a similar
speculation? That the shrievalty of London (<i>i.e.</i> London
and Middlesex) was purchased by payments "de gersoma" is
a matter, itself, not of inference, but of fact. Fulcred fitz
Walter is debited in the Pipe-Rolls with a sum of "cxx marcas
argenti de Gersoma pro Vicecomitatu Londoniæ."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1043" id="Ref_1043" href="#Foot_1043">[1043]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>firmarius</i> who had succeeded in obtaining a lease would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">{361}</a></span>
have to recoup himself, of course, from his receipts the amount
of the actual "firma" <i>plus</i> his payment "de gersoma," before
he could derive for himself any profit whatever from the transaction.
This implied that he had closely to shear the flock
committed to his charge. If he was a mere speculator, unconnected
with his sphere of operations, he would have no scruple
in doing this, and would resort to every means of extortion.
What those means were it is now difficult to tell, for, obscure
as the financial system of the Norman period may be, it is clear
that just as the <i>rotulus exactorius</i> recorded the amounts to which
the king was entitled from the <i>firmarii</i> of the various counties,
so these <i>firmarii</i>, in their turn, were entitled to sums of ostensibly
fixed amount from the various constituents of their
counties' "corpora." Domesday, however, while recording
these sums, shows us, in many remarkable cases, a larger "redditus"
being paid than that which was strictly due. The fact
is that we are, and must be, to a great extent, in the dark as
to the fixity of these ostensibly stereotyped payments. That
the remarkable rise in the annual <i>firmæ</i> exacted from the towns
which, Domesday shows us, had taken place since, and consequent
on, the Conquest would seem to imply that these <i>firmæ</i>,
under the loose <i>régime</i> of the old system, had been allowed to
remain so long unaltered that they had become antiquated and
unduly low. In any case the Conqueror raised them sharply,
probably according to his estimate of the financial capacity of
the town. And this step would, of course, involve a rise in the
total of the <i>firma</i> exacted from the <i>corpus comitatus</i>. The
precedent which his father had thus set was probably followed
by Henry I., who appears to have exacted, systematically, the
uttermost farthing. It was probably, however, to the oppressive
use of the "placita" included in the "firma comitatus"
that the sheriffs mainly trusted to increase their receipts.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been the means of extortion possessed
by the sheriffs in the towns within their rule,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1044" id="Ref_1044" href="#Foot_1044">[1044]</a></span> and exercised
by them to recoup themselves for the increased demands
of the Crown, we know that such means there must have been,
or it would not have been worth the while of the towns to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">{362}</a></span>
offer considerable sums for the privilege of paying their <i>firmæ</i>
to the Crown directly, instead of through the sheriffs.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1045" id="Ref_1045" href="#Foot_1045">[1045]</a></span></p>

<p>I would now institute a comparison between the cases of
Lincoln and of London. In both cases the city formed part of
the <i>corpus comitatus</i>; in both, therefore, its <i>firma</i> was included
in the total ferm of the shire. Lincoln was at this time one of
the largest and wealthiest towns in the country. Its citizens evidently
had reason to complain of the exactions of the sheriff of
the shire. London, we infer, was in the same plight. Both cities
were, accordingly, anxious to exclude the financial intervention
of the sheriff between themselves and the Crown. How was
this end to be attained? It was attained in two different ways
varying with the circumstances of the two cases. London was
considerably larger than Lincoln, and Middlesex infinitely
smaller than Lincolnshire. Thus while the <i>firma</i> of Lincoln
represented less than a fifth of the ferm of the shire,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1046" id="Ref_1046" href="#Foot_1046">[1046]</a></span> that of
London would, of course, constitute the bulk of the ferm of
Middlesex. Lincoln, therefore, would only seek to sever itself
financially from the shire; London, on the contrary, would
endeavour to exclude, still more effectually, the sheriff, by
itself boldly stepping into the sheriff's shoes. The action of
the citizens of Lincoln is revealed to us by the Roll of 1130:—</p>

<p class="small">"Burgenses Lincolie reddunt compotum de cc marcis argenti et iiij
marcis auri ut teneant ciuitatem de Rege in capite" (p. 114).</p>

<p>The same Roll is witness to that of the citizens of London:—</p>

<p class="small">"Homines Londonie reddunt compotum de c marcis argenti ut habeant
Vic[ecomitem?] ad electionem suam" (p. 148).</p>

<p>I contend that these two passages ought to be read together.
No one appears to have observed the fact that the sequel to
the above Lincoln entry is to be found in the Pipe-Roll of 1157
(3 Hen. II.). We there find £140 deducted from the ferm of
the shire in consideration of the severance of the city from the
<i>corpus comitatus</i> ("Et in Civitate Lincol[nie] CXL libræ blancæ").
But we further find the citizens of Lincoln, in accounting for
their <i>firma</i> to the Crown direct, accounting not for £140, but for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">{363}</a></span>
£180. It must, consequently, have been worth their while to
offer the Crown a sum equivalent to about a year's rental for
the privilege of paying it £180 direct rather than £140 through
the sheriff.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1047" id="Ref_1047" href="#Foot_1047">[1047]</a></span> Such figures are eloquent as to the extortions
from which they had suffered. The citizens of London, as I
have said, set to work a different way. They simply sought
to lease the shrievalty of the shire themselves. I can, on
careful consideration, offer no other suggestion than that the
hundred marcs for which they account in the Roll of 1130,
represent the payment by which they secured a lease of the
shrievalty for the year 1129-1130, the shrievalty being held in
that year by the "quatuor vicecomites" of the Roll. I gather
from the Roll that Fulcred fitz Walter had been sheriff for
1128-29, and his payment "de gersoma" is, I take it, represented
in the case of the following year (1129-30) by these hundred
marks, the "quatuor vicecomites" themselves having paid
nothing "de gersoma." On this view, the citizens must have
leased the shrievalty themselves and then put in four of their
fellows, as representing them, to hold it. But, obviously, such
a post was not one to be coveted. To exact sufficient from
their fellow-citizens wherewith to meet the claims of the Crown
would be a task neither popular nor pleasant. Indeed, the
fact of the citizens installing four "vicecomites" may imply
that they could not find any one man who would consent to
fill a post as thankless as that of the hapless <i>decurio</i> in the
provinces of the Roman Empire, or of the chamberlain, in a
later age, in the country towns of England. Hence it may be
that we find it thus placed in commission. Hence, also, the
eagerness of these <i>vicecomites</i> to be quit of office, as shown by
their payment, for that privilege, of two marcs of gold apiece.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1048" id="Ref_1048" href="#Foot_1048">[1048]</a></span>
It may, however, be frankly confessed that the nature of this
payment is not so clear as could be wished. Judging from the
very ancient practice with regard to municipal offices, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">{364}</a></span>
would have thought that such payments would probably have
been made to their fellow-citizens who had thrust on them the
office rather than to the Crown. Moreover, if their year of
office was over, and the city's lease at an end, one would have
thought they would be freed from office in the ordinary course
of things. The only explanation, perhaps, that suggests itself
is that they purchased from the Crown an exemption from
serving again even though their fellow-citizens should again
elect them to office.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1049" id="Ref_1049" href="#Foot_1049">[1049]</a></span> But I leave the point in doubt.</p>

<p>The hypothesis, it will be seen, that I have here advanced
is that the citizens leased the shrievalty (so far as we know,
for the first time) for the year 1129-30. We have the names
of those who held the shrievalty at various periods in the course
of the reign, before this year, but there is no evidence that,
throughout this period, it was ever leased to the citizens. The
important question which now arises is this: How does this
view affect the charter granted to the citizens by Henry I.?</p>

<p>We have first to consider the date to which the charter
should be assigned. Mr. Loftie characteristically observes that
Rymer, "from the names appended to it or some other evidence,
dates it in 1101."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1050" id="Ref_1050" href="#Foot_1050">[1050]</a></span> As a matter of fact, Rymer
assigns no year to it; nor, indeed, did Rymer himself even
include it in his work. In the modern enlarged edition of that
work the charter is printed, but without a date, nor was it till
1885 that in the Record Office <i>Syllabus</i>, begun by Sir T. D.
Hardy, the date 1101 was assigned to it.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1051" id="Ref_1051" href="#Foot_1051">[1051]</a></span> That date is possibly
to be traced to Northouck's <i>History of London</i> (1773), in
which the commencement of Henry's reign is suggested as a
probable period (p. 27). This view is set forth also in a
modern work upon the subject.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1052" id="Ref_1052" href="#Foot_1052">[1052]</a></span> It is not often that we meet
with a charter so difficult to date. The <i>formula</i> of address, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">{365}</a></span>
it includes justices, points, according to my own theory, to a
late period in the reign, as also does the differentiation between
the justice and the sheriff. And the witnesses do the same.
But there is, unfortunately, no witness of sufficient prominence
to enable us to fix the date with precision. All that we can say
is that such a name as that of Hugh Bigod points to the period
1123-1135, and that, of the nine witnesses named, seven or
eight figure in the Pipe-Roll of 1130 (31 Hen. I.). This would
suggest that these two documents must be of about the same date.
Now, though we cannot trace the tenure of the shrievalty before
Michaelmas, 1128, from the Roll, there is, as I have said, no
sign that this charter had come into play. Nor is it easy to
understand how or why it could be withdrawn within a very
few years of its grant. In short, for this view there is not
a scrap of evidence; against it, is all probability. If, on the
contrary, we adopt the hypothesis which I am now going to
advance, namely, that the charter was later than the Pipe-Roll,
the difficulties all vanish. By this view, the lease for a year,
to which the Pipe-Roll bears witness, would be succeeded by
a permanent arrangement, that lease of the ferm in perpetuity,
which we find recorded in the charter.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, evident that the contrary view rests solely on
the guess at "1101," or on the assumption of Dr. Stubbs that
the charter was earlier than the Pipe-Roll. Mr. Freeman and
others have merely followed him. Dr. Stubbs writes thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Between the date of Henry's charter and that of the great Pipe-Roll,
some changes in the organization of the City must have taken place. In 1130
there were four sheriffs or vicecomites, who jointly account for the ferm of
London, instead of the one mentioned in the charter; and part of the account
is rendered by a chamberlain of the City. The right to appoint the sheriffs
has been somehow withdrawn, for the citizens pay a hundred marks of silver
that they may have a sheriff of their own choice," etc., etc.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1053" id="Ref_1053" href="#Foot_1053">[1053]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">But our great historian nowhere tells us what he considers
"the date of Henry's charter" to have been. If that date was
subsequent to the Pipe-Roll, the whole of his argument falls to
the ground.</p>

<p>The substitution of four sheriffs for one, to which Dr. Stubbs
alludes, is a matter of slight consequence, for the number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">{366}</a></span>
the "vicecomites" varies throughout. As a matter of fact,
the abbreviated forms leave us, as in the Pipe-Roll of 1130,
doubtful whether we ought to read "vicecomite<i>m</i>" or "vicecomite<i>s</i>,"
and even if the former is the one intended, we know,
both in this and other cases, that there was nothing unusual
in putting the office in commission between two or more. As
to the chamberlain, he does not figure in connection with the
<i>firma</i>, with which alone we are here concerned. But, oddly
enough, Dr. Stubbs has overlooked the really important point,
namely, that the <i>firma</i> is not £300, as fixed by the charter, but
over £500.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1054" id="Ref_1054" href="#Foot_1054">[1054]</a></span> This increases the discrepancy on which Dr. Stubbs
lays stress. The most natural inference from this fact is that,
as on several later occasions, the Crown had greatly raised the
<i>firma</i> (which had been under the Conqueror £300), and that
the citizens now, by a heavy payment, secured its reduction to
the original figure. Thus, on my hypothesis that the charter
was granted between 1130 and 1135, the Crown must have been
tempted, by the offer of an enormous sum down, to grant
(1) a lease in perpetuity, (2) a reduction of the fee-farm rent
("firma") to £300 a year. As the sum to which the <i>firma</i>
had been raised by the king, together with the annual <i>gersoma</i>,
amounted to some £600 a year, such a reduction can only
have been purchased by a large payment in ready money.</p>

<p>It was, of course, by such means as these that Henry
accumulated the vast "hoard" that the treasury held at his
death. He may not improbably in collecting this wealth have
kept in view what appears to have been the supreme aim of his
closing years, namely, the securing of the succession to his
heirs. This was to prove the means by which their claims
should be supported. It would, perhaps, be refining too much
to suggest that he hoped by this charter to attach the citizens
to the interests of his line, on whom alone it could be binding.
In any case his efforts were notoriously vain, for London
headed throughout the opposition to the claims of his heirs.
I cannot but think that his financial system had much to do
with this result, and that, as with the Hebrews at the death of
Solomon, the citizens of London bethought them only of his
"grievous service" and his "heavy yoke," as when they met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">{367}</a></span>
the demand of his daughter for an enormous sum of money<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1055" id="Ref_1055" href="#Foot_1055">[1055]</a></span>
by bluntly requesting a return to the system of Edward the
Confessor.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1056" id="Ref_1056" href="#Foot_1056">[1056]</a></span></p>

<p>In any case the concessions in Henry's charter were wholly
ignored both by Stephen and by the Empress, when they granted
in turn to the Earl of Essex the shrievalty of London and
Middlesex (1141-42).</p>

<p>A fresh and important point must, however, now be raised.
What was the attitude of Henry II. towards his grandfather's
charter? Of our two latest writers on the subject, Mr. Loftie
tells us that</p>

<p class="small nodent">"Henry II. was too astute a ruler not to put himself at once on a good footing
with the citizens. One of his first acts was to confirm the Great Charter
of his grandfather."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1057" id="Ref_1057" href="#Foot_1057">[1057]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Norgate similarly asserts that "the charter granted
by Henry II. to the citizens, some time before the end of 1158,
is simply a confirmation of his grandfather's."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1058" id="Ref_1058" href="#Foot_1058">[1058]</a></span> Such, indeed,
would seem to be the accepted belief. Yet, when we compare
the two documents, we find that the special concessions with
which I am here dealing, and which form the opening clauses
of the charter of Henry I., are actually omitted altogether in
that of Henry II.!<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1059" id="Ref_1059" href="#Foot_1059">[1059]</a></span> This leads us to examine the rest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">{368}</a></span>
latter document. To facilitate this process I have here arranged
the two charters side by side, and divided their contents into
numbered clauses, italicizing the points of difference.</p>

<p>Before passing to a comparison of these charters, we must
glance at the question of texts. The charter of Henry I. is
taken from the <i>Select Charters</i> of Dr. Stubbs, who has gone to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">{370}</a></span>
the <i>Fœdera</i> for his text (which is taken from an Inspeximus of
5 Edw. IV.). That of Henry II. is taken from the transcript
in the <i>Liber Custumarum</i> (collated with the <i>Liber Rubeus</i>).
Neither of these sources is by any means as pure as could be
wished. The names of the witnesses in both had always aroused
my suspicions,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1077" id="Ref_1077" href="#Foot_1077">[1077]</a></span> but the collation of the two charters has led to
a singular discovery. It will be noticed that in the charter of
Henry I. the citizens are guaranteed "terras <i>et wardemotum</i> et
debita sua." Now, this is on the face of it an unmeaning combination.
Why should the wardmoot be thus sandwiched
between the lands of the citizens and the debts due to them?
And what can be the meaning of confirming to them their
wardmoot (? wardmoots), when the hustings is only mentioned
as an infliction and the folkmoot as a medium of extortion?
Yet, corrupt though this passage, on the face of it, appears,
our authorities have risen at this unlucky word, if I may
venture on the expression, like pike. Dr. Stubbs, Professor
Freeman, Miss Norgate, Mr. Green, Mr. Loftie, Mr. Price, etc.,
etc., have all swallowed it without suspicion. Historians, like
doctors, may often differ, but truly "when they do agree their
unanimity is wonderful." Collation, however, fortunately
proves that "wardemotum" is nothing more than a gross misreading
of "vadimonia," a word which restores to the passage
its sense by showing that what Henry confirmed to the citizens
was "the property mortgaged to them, and the debts due to
them."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1078" id="Ref_1078" href="#Foot_1078">[1078]</a></span></p>

<p>Having thus enforced the necessity for caution in arguing
from the text as it stands, I would urge that, with the exception
of the avowed addition at the close, the later charter has, in
sundry details, the aspect of a grudging confirmation, restricting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">{371}</a></span>
rather than enlarging the benefits conferred. This, however,
is but a small matter in comparison with its total omission of
the main concession itself. This fact, so strangely overlooked,
coincides with the king's allusion to the sheriff as "vicecomes
<i>meus</i>" (no longer the citizens' sheriff),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1079" id="Ref_1079" href="#Foot_1079">[1079]</a></span> but explains above all
the circumstance, which would be quite inexplicable without
it, that the <i>firma</i> is again, under Henry II., found to be not
£300, but over £500 a year.</p>

<p>In 1164 (10 Hen. II.) the <i>firma</i> of London, if I reckon it
right, was, as in 1130 (31 Hen. I.), about £520.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1080" id="Ref_1080" href="#Foot_1080">[1080]</a></span> In 1160
(6 Hen. II.) it was a few pounds less,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1081" id="Ref_1081" href="#Foot_1081">[1081]</a></span> and in 1161 (7 Hen. II.)
it was little, it would seem, over £500.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1082" id="Ref_1082" href="#Foot_1082">[1082]</a></span> But in these calculations
it is virtually impossible to attain perfect accuracy, not
only from the system of keeping accounts partly in <i>libræ</i> partly
in <i>marcæ</i>, and partly in money "blanched" partly in money
"numero," but also from the fact that the figures on the Pipe-Rolls
are by no means so infallible as might be supposed.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1083" id="Ref_1083" href="#Foot_1083">[1083]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor does the charter of Richard I. (April 23, 1194) make
any change. It merely confirms that of his father. But John,
in addition to confirming this (June 17, 1199), granted a
supplementary charter (July 5, 1199)—</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">{372}</a></div>

<p class="small">"Sciatis nos concessisse et præsenti Charta nostra confirmasse civibus
Londoniarum Vicecomitatum Londoniarum et de Middelsexia, cum omnibus
rebus et consuetudinibus quæ pertinent ad prædictum Vicecomitatum ...

blancorum.... Et præterea concessimus civibus Londoniarum, quod ipsi
de se ipsis faciant Vicecomites quoscunque voluerint, et amoveant quando
voluerint; ... Hanc vero concessionem et confirmationem fecimus civibus
Londoniarum propter emendationem ejusdem civitatis et quia antiquitus
consuevit esse ad firmam pro ccc libris."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1084" id="Ref_1084" href="#Foot_1084">[1084]</a></span></p>

<p>Here at length we return to the concessions of Henry I., with
which this charter of John ought to be carefully compared.
With the exception of the former's provision about the "justiciar"
(an exception which must not be overlooked), the
concessions are the same. The subsequent raising of the <i>firma</i>
to £400 (in 1270), and its eventual reduction to £300 (in 1327),
have been already dealt with (pp. 358, 359).</p>

<p>We see then that, in absolute contradiction of the received
belief on the subject, the shrievalty was not in the hands of
the citizens during the twelfth century (<i>i.e.</i> from "1101"),
but was held by them for a few years only, about the close of
the reign of Henry I. The fact that the sheriffs of London
and Middlesex were, under Henry II. and Richard I., appointed
throughout by the Crown, must compel our historians to
reconsider the independent position they have assigned to the
City at that early period. The Crown, moreover, must have
had an object in retaining this appointment in its hands. We
may find it, I think, in that jealousy of exceptional privilege
or exemption which characterized the <i>régime</i> of Henry II. For,
as I have shown, the charters to Geoffrey remind us that the
ambition of the urban communities was analogous to that of
the great feudatories in so far as they both strove for exemption
from official rule. It was precisely to this ambition that
Henry II. was opposed; and thus, when he granted his charter
to London, he wholly omitted, as we have seen, two of his
grandfather's concessions, and narrowed down those that
remained, that they might not be operative outside the actual
walls of the city. When the shrievalty was restored by John
to the citizens (1199), the concession had lost its chief importance
through the triumph of the "communal" principle.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">{373}</a></span>
When that civic revolution had taken place which introduced
the "communa" with its mayor—a revolution to which
Henry II. would never, writes the chronicler, have submitted—when
a Londoner was able to boast that he would have no
king but his mayor, then had the sheriff's position become but
of secondary importance, subordinate, as it has remained ever
since, to that of the mayor himself.</p>

<p>The transient existence of the local <i>justitiarius</i> is a phenomenon
of great importance, which has been wholly misunderstood.
The Mandeville charters afford the clue to the nature
of this office. It represents a middle term, a transitional stage,
between the essentially <i>local</i> shire-reeve and the <i>central</i> "justice"
of the king's court. I have already (p. 106) shown that the
office sprang from "the differentiation of the sheriff and the
justice," and represented, as it were, the localization of the
central judicial element. That is to say, the <i>justitiarius</i> for
Essex, or Herts., or London and Middlesex, was a purely local
officer, and yet exercised, within the limits of his bailiwick, all
the authority of the king's justice. So transient was this state of
things that scarcely a trace of it remains. Yet Richard de Luci
may have held the post, as we saw (p. 109), for the county of
Essex, and there is evidence that Norfolk had a justice of its
own in the person of Ralf Passelewe.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1085" id="Ref_1085" href="#Foot_1085">[1085]</a></span> Now, in the case of
London, the office was created by the charter of Henry I.,
granted (as I contend) towards the end of his reign, and it
expired with the accession of Henry II. It is, therefore, in
Stephen's reign that we should expect to find it in existence;
and it is precisely in that reign that we find the office <i>eo nomine</i>
twice granted to the Earl of Essex and twice mentioned as held
by Gervase, otherwise Gervase of Cornhill.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1086" id="Ref_1086" href="#Foot_1086">[1086]</a></span></p>

<p>The office of the "Justiciar of London" should now be no
longer obscure; its possible identity with those of portreeve,
sheriff, or mayor cannot, surely, henceforth be maintained.</p>

On the somewhat thorny question of the right extension of "Lond'"
(Lond<i>onia</i> or Lond<i>oniæ</i>) I would explain at the outset that both forms, the
singular and the plural, are found, so that either extension is legitimate.
I have seen no reason to change my belief (as set forth in the <i>Athenæum</i>,
1887) that "Londoni<i>a</i>" is the Latinization of the English "Londone," and
"Londoni<i>æ</i>" of the Norman "Londres."</p>

A remarkable illustration of this loose usage is afforded by the case of
the archdeaconry. Take the styles of Ralph "de Diceto." Dr. Stubbs writes
of his archdeaconry: "That it was the archdeaconry of Middlesex is certain
... it is beyond doubt, and wherever Ralph is called Archdeacon of
London, it is only loosely in reference to the fact that he was one of the four
archdeacons of the diocese" (<i>Radulfi de Diceto Opera</i>, I. xxxv., xxxvi.). But,
as to this explanation, the writer adduces no evidence in support of this
view, that all "four archdeacons" might be described, loosely, as "of
London." Indeed, he admits, further on (p. xl., <i>note</i>), "that the title of
Essex or Colchester is generally given to the holders of these two archdeaconries,
so that really the only two between which confusion was likely
to arise were London and Middlesex." Now, in a very formal document,
quoted by Dr. Stubbs himself (p. 1., <i>note</i>), Ralph is emphatically styled
"Archdeacon of London." It is clear, therefore, that, in the case of this
archdeaconry, that style was fully recognized, and the explanation of this is
to be found, I would suggest, in the use, exemplified in the text <i>ut supra</i>,
of "London" and "Middlesex" as convertible terms.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_1015" id="Foot_1015" href="#Ref_1015">[1015]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Mr. Freeman himself makes the same mistake, and insists on regarding
Middlesex as a subject district round the City.</p>

Even Dr. Sharpe, the learned editor of the valuable <i>Calendar of
Hustings Wills</i>, is similarly puzzled by a grant of twenty-five marks out of
the king's ferm "de civitate London," to be paid annually by the sheriffs
of London and Middlesex (i. 610), because he imagines that the <i>firma</i> was
paid in respect of the sheriffwick of Middlesex alone.</p>

 <td>"It has been supposed that the justiciar here mentioned means a
 mayor or chief magistrate, and that the grant includes that of the
 election of the supreme executive officer of the City. It may be so,
 but all probability is against this view. For by this time the citizens
 already appear to have selected their own portreeve, by whatever name
 he was called; and it is absurd to suppose that the king gave them
 power to appoint a sheriff of Middlesex, if they were not already
 allowed to appoint their own. The omission of any reference to the
 portreeve in the charter cannot, in fact, be otherwise accounted for"

 <td>"The next substantial benefit they derived from the charter was the
 leave to elect their own justiciar. They may place whom they will to
 hold pleas of the Crown. The portreeve is here evidently intended, for
 it is manifestly absurd to suppose, as some have done, that Henry
 allowed the citizens to elect a reeve for Middlesex, if they could not
 elect one for themselves; and if proof were wanting, we have it in the
 references to the trials before the portreeve which are found in very
 early documents. In one of these, which cannot be dated later than
 1115, Gilbert Proudfoot, or Prutfot, described as vicecomes, is
 mentioned as having some time before given judgment against the dean
 and chapter as to a piece of land on the present site of the Bank of
 England" (<i>London</i>, p. 29).</td>

the history of which is now lost, but which might account for the earnest

Charters</i>, p. 300) he writes: "How long the Portreeve of London continued
to exist is not known; perhaps until he was merged in the <i>mayor</i>." I have

The first two witnesses to that of Henry I. are given as "episcopo
Winton., Roberto filio Richer. (<i>sic</i>)." The bishop's initial ought to be given,
and the second witness is probably identical with Robert fitz Rich<i>ard</i>.
"Huberto (<i>sic</i>) regis camerario" has also a suspicious sound. In the second
charter the witnesses are given in the <i>Liber Custumarum</i> as "Archiepiscopo
Cantuariæ, Ricardo Episcopo Londoniarum." Here, again, the primate's
initial should be given; as, indeed, it is in the (more accurate) <i>Liber Rubeus</i>
version, where (<i>vide supra</i>, p. 367) all the witnesses are entered.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_1079" id="Foot_1079" href="#Ref_1079">[1079]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In confirmation of this view, it may be pointed out that where this
same clause occurs in charters to other towns, the words are "vicecomes
<i>noster</i>" in cases, as at Winchester, where the king retains in his hand the
appointment of reeve, but simply (as at Lincoln) "præpositus" or (as at
Northampton) "præpositus Northamtonie," where the right to elect the
reeve was also conceded.</p>

As an example of the possibility of error, in the printed Roll of 1159
(5 Hen. II.) a town is entered on the Roll as paying "quater xx. lv.
libras et ii marcas et dim'." The explanation of this unintelligible entry
is, I may observe, as follows. The original entry evidently ran, "quater xx
et ii marcas et dim'" (82½ marcs). Over this a scribe will have written the
equivalent amount in pounds ("lv libræ") by interlineation. Then came
the modern transcriber, who with the stupidity of a mechanical copyist
brought down this interlineation into the middle of the entry, thus converting
it into sheer nonsense. We have also to reckon with such clerical errors as
the addition or omission of an "x" or an "i," of a "bl." or a "no." Where
the total to be accounted for is stated separately, we have a means of checking
the accounts. But where, as at London, this is not so, we cannot be too
careful in accepting the details as given. See also Addenda.</p>

who was a wealthy kinsman of Becket and employed
him, in his house, as a clerk about this very time (<i>circ.</i> 1139-1142).
We meet him as "Osbertus VIII. denarii" at London
in 1130 (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 31 Hen. I.), and I have also found him
attesting a charter of Henry I., late in the reign, as "Osberto

"Ottdeners") witnessing a treaty arrangement between the
Earls of Hereford and Gloucester. This he did in his capacity
of feudal tenant to the latter, for in the Earl of Gloucester's
<i>Carta</i> (1166) of his tenants in Kent we read: "Feodum Osberti
oitdeniers i mil[item]," from which we learn that he had held
one knight's fee.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>This singular <i>cognomen</i>, though savouring of the nickname

<p>As I have here alluded to Becket it may be permissible to
mention that as the statements of his biographers in the matter
of Osbert are confirmed by this extraneous evidence, so have
we also evidence in charters of his residence, as "Thomas of
London," in the primate's household. To two charters of
Theobald to Earls Colne Priory the first witness is "Thoma
Lond' Capellano nostro,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1093" id="Ref_1093" href="#Foot_1093">[1093]</a></span> while an even more interesting
charter of the primate brings before us those three names,
which, says William of Canterbury, were those of his three
intimates, the first witness being Roger of Bishopsbridge, while
the fourth and fifth are John of Canterbury and Thomas of
London, "clerks."<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>A similar provision will be found in the charter to Aubrey
de Vere. It is evident from these special provisions that the
grantees attached a peculiar importance to this indemnity for
their assarts; and it is equally noteworthy that the Empress
is careful to restrict that indemnity to those assarts which had
been made before a certain date ("facta usque ad diem quâ,"
etc.). This restriction should be compared with that which
similarly limited the indemnity claimed by the barons of the
Exchequer,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1096" id="Ref_1096" href="#Foot_1096">[1096]</a></span> and which has been somewhat overlooked.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1097" id="Ref_1097" href="#Foot_1097">[1097]</a></span></p>

<p>Assarts are duly dealt with in the <i>Leges Henrici Primi</i>,
and would form an important part of the "placita forestæ"
in his reign. It is reasonable to presume that one of the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">{377}</a></span>
results of the removal of his iron hand would be a violent
reaction against the tyranny of "the forest." Indeed, we know
that Stephen was compelled to give way upon the point. A
general outburst of "assarting" would at once follow. Thus
the prospect of the return, with the Empress, of her father's
forest-law would greatly alarm the offenders who were guilty
of "assarts."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1098" id="Ref_1098" href="#Foot_1098">[1098]</a></span></p>

<p>But, further, the earl's fief lay away from the forest proper.
Why, then, was this concession of such importance in his eyes?
We are helped towards an answer to this question by Mr.
Fisher's learned and instructive work on <i>The Forest of Essex</i>.
The facts there given, though needing some slight correction,
show us that the Crown asserted in the reign of Henry III.,
that the portion of the county which had been afforested since
the accession of Henry II. had (with the exception of the
hundred of Tendring) been merely <i>re</i>afforested, having been
already "forest" at the death of Henry I., though under
Stephen it had ceased to be so. This claim, which was successfully
asserted, affected more than half the county. Now, it
is singular that throughout the struggle, on this subject, with
the Crown, the true forest, that of Waltham (now Epping), was
always conceded to be "within forest." Mr. Fisher's valuable
maps show its limits clearly. It was, accordingly, tacitly
admitted by the perambulation consequent on the Charter of
the Forest to have been "forest" before 1154.</p>

<p>The theory suggested to me by these <i>data</i> is this. Stephen,
we know, by his Charter of Liberties consented that all the
forests created by Henry I. should be disafforested, and retained
for himself only those which had been "forest" in the days
of the first and the second William. Under this arrangement
he retained, I hold, the small true forest (Waltham forest),
but had to resign the grasp of the Crown on the additions made
to it by Henry I., which amounted to considerably more than
half the county. My view that this sweeping extension of
"forest" was the work of Henry I. is confirmed by the fact
that his "forest" policy is admittedly the most objectionable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">{378}</a></span>
feature of his rule. Nor, I take it, was it inspired so much
by the love of sport as by the great facilities it afforded for
pecuniary exaction. In the Pipe-Roll of his thirty-first year
we find (to adapt an old saying) "forest pleas as thick as
fleas" in Essex, affording proof, moreover, that his "forest"
had extended to the extreme north-east of the Lexden hundred.
Here then again, I believe, as in so many other matters,
Henry II. ignored his predecessor, and reverted to the <i>status
quo ante</i>. Nor was the claim he revived finally set at rest, till
Parliament disposed of it for ever in the days of Charles I.</p>

<p>An interesting charter bearing on this subject is preserved
to us by Inspeximus.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1099" id="Ref_1099" href="#Foot_1099">[1099]</a></span> It records the restoration by Stephen
to the Abbess of Barking of all her estates afforested by
Henry I.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1100" id="Ref_1100" href="#Foot_1100">[1100]</a></span> Now, this charter, which is tested at Clarendon
(perhaps the only record of Stephen being there), is witnessed
by W[illiam] Martel, A[ubrey] de Ver, and E[ustace] fitz
John. The name of this last witness<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1101" id="Ref_1101" href="#Foot_1101">[1101]</a></span> dates the charter as
previous to 1138 (when he threw over Stephen), and, virtually,
to the king's departure for Normandy early in 1137. Consequently
(and this is an important point) we here have Stephen
granting, as a favour, to Barking Abbey what he had promised
in his great charter to grant universally.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1102" id="Ref_1102" href="#Foot_1102">[1102]</a></span> This confirms the
charge made by Henry of Huntingdon that he repudiated the
concession he had made. His subsequent troubles, however,
must have made it difficult for him to adhere to this policy,
or check the process of assarting. His grant to the abbess was
unknown to Mr. Fisher, who records an inquest of 1292, by
which it was found that the woods of the abbess were "without
the Regard;" and the Regarders were forbidden to exercise
their authority within them.</p>

<small>THE TREATY OF ALLIANCE BETWEEN THE EARLS OF HEREFORD AND GLOUCESTER.</small></h3>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
document which is printed below is unknown, it would
seem, to historians. It is of a very singular and, in many ways,
of a most instructive character. The fact that Earl Miles is
one of the contracting parties dates the document as belonging
to the period between his creation (July 25, 1141) and his
death (December 24, 1143). Further, the fact that the treaty
provides for the surrender by him to the Earl of Gloucester of
one of his sons as a hostage, taken with the fact that the Earl
of Gloucester is recorded (<i>supra</i>, p. 196) to have demanded
from his leading supporters their sons as hostages when he left
England for Normandy, creates an extremely strong presumption
that this document should be assigned to that occasion
(June, 1142). It is here printed from a transcript by Dugdale,
which I found among his MSS. The absence of any provision
defining the services to be rendered by Earl Miles suggests that
this portion of the treaty is omitted in the transcript. There is,
I think, just a chance that the original may yet be discovered
among the public records, for they fortunately contain a similar
treaty between the sons and successors of the two contracting
parties.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1103" id="Ref_1103" href="#Foot_1103">[1103]</a></span> It may be, however, that the original is the document
referred to by Dugdale (<i>Baronage</i>, i. 537) as "penes Joh. Philipot
Somerset Heraldum anno 1640." The close resemblance between
the later document<span class="fnanchor"><a href="#Foot_1103">[1103]</a></span>
and that which I here print confirms the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">{380}</a></span>
authenticity of the latter, and is, it will be seen, illustrated by
the wording of the opening clauses:—</p>

<p class="nodent">We have also the noteworthy coincidence that Richard de St.

between the Earls of Chester and of Leicester,<span class="fnanchor"><a

suggests by its title—"Hæc est conventio ... et finalis pax et
concordia," etc.—the settlement of a strife between them rather
than a friendly alliance. I see in it, indeed, the intervention,
if not the arbitration, of the Church.</p>

<p>Both these alliances, again, should be compared, for their

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">"Hanc</span>
autem ... affidavi manu mea propria in manu ipsius
Comitis Gaufredi." This formula ("affidavi ... in manu")
is deserving of careful study. It ought to be compared with
a passage in the <i>Chronicle of Abingdon</i> (ii. 160), describing how,
some quarter of a century before, in the assembled county
court (<i>comitatus</i>) of Berkshire, the delegate of the abbey, "pro
ecclesiâ affidavit fidem in manu ipsius vicecomitis, vidente
toto comitatu." This was a case of "affidatio" by proxy; but
in the above charter we find Geoffrey stipulating for "affidatio"
in person ("propria manu") by the Empress, her husband, and
her son. Accordingly, when the young Henry confirms his
mother's charter to Aubrey de Vere (see p. 186), he does so
"manu mea propria in manu Hugonis de Inga, sicut mater
mea Imperatrix affidavit in manu Comitis Gaufredi." Thus
Geoffrey allowed himself the privilege, which he refused to
the other contracting party, of "affidatio" by proxy, and made
Hugh de Ing his delegate for the purpose.</p>

<p>A curious allusion to this practice is found in the words of
Ranulf Flambard some half a century earlier, when he promises
the captor in whose power he was to grant him all that he can
ask, "et ne discredas promissis, ecce <i>manu affirmo</i> quod polliceor."—Continuatio
Historiæ Turgoti (<i>Anglia Sacra</i>, i. 707).
The formula was probably of great antiquity. It occurs in the
lifetime of Archbishop Oswald (died 992), who obtained a
lease for life on behalf of a certain Wulfric, of the provisions
in which we read: "Hoc totum idem Wlfricus, sub oculis
multorum qui aderant, <i>in manu</i> viri Dei qui pro eo intercessor
accesserat <i>affidavit</i>" (<i>Chron. Ram.</i>, p. 81). It is found, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">{385}</a></span>
as late as 1187, when at the foundation of Dodnash
Priory the canons "juraverunt et fidem <i>in manu nostra</i> corporaliter
... firmaverunt," says the bishop (<i>Ancient Charters</i>,
p. 88). Another late instance is found in the <i>Burton Cartulary</i>
(fol. 33), where Robert fitz Walter, that his grant "inconcussum
permaneat, in toto comitatu, multis cementibus qui se
ipsos testes concesserunt, in manu Vicecomitis Serlonis manu
meâ hoc tenendum et servandum affidavi." So also in the Pipe-Roll
of 3 John we find recorded a lease, "et quod ipse Micael
et Everardus frater suus affidaverunt in manu H. Cantuarensis
Arch. hanc Conventionem fideliter tenendam" (Rot. 6 <i>b</i>). An
instance, in 1159, may be quoted from the <i>Cartulary of St. Michael
on the Mount</i> because of its curious legal bearing. Robert de
Belvoir mortgages to the abbey lands which he had settled
on his wife in dower, and, in order to bar her claim, she,
<i>by her brother</i>, guarantees the transaction by "affidatio in
manu" to the abbot's delegate.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1113" id="Ref_1113" href="#Foot_1113">[1113]</a></span> This arrangement should be
compared with that which is discussed in my <i>Ancient Charters</i>,
pp. 22, 23.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1114" id="Ref_1114" href="#Foot_1114">[1114]</a></span> Perhaps, however, the most singular case is one
which I noted in the <i>Cartulary</i> (MS.) <i>of Rievaulx</i>, and which
is also of the reign of Henry II. A widow grants lands to
that abbey, "et illam donationem tenendam et fideliter observandam
manu propria affidavit in manu Vicecomitissæ, vid.
Bert[æ] uxoris vicecomitis Ranulfi de Glanvill[a]."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1115" id="Ref_1115" href="#Foot_1115">[1115]</a></span> The
conjunction here of the two women, the presence of the great
Glanville himself, and the part played by his wife, together
with the title assigned her, all combine to render the transaction
one of unusual interest.</p>

<p>It was by this formal and binding pledge that the leaders
of the English host swore to one another to do or die on the
field of the Battle of the Standard. Turning to William of
Aumâle, and placing his hand in his, Walter Espec pledged
his faith that he would conquer or be slain; and his fellow-commanders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">{386}</a></span>
did the same."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1116" id="Ref_1116" href="#Foot_1116">[1116]</a></span> It was, again, by this solemn
pledge, towards the close of Stephen's reign, that the Bishop
of Winchester, before his brother prelates, covenanted to surrender
Winchester to the duke at the king's death<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1117" id="Ref_1117" href="#Foot_1117">[1117]</a></span>—even as
the duke himself had covenanted (April 9, 1152) with the
Bishop of Salisbury concerning Devizes Castle<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1118" id="Ref_1118" href="#Foot_1118">[1118]</a></span>—in terms to be
closely compared with those of his charter to Aubrey, and his
mother's to Earl Geoffrey in 1142.</p>

<p>The practice is, I find, alluded to, incidentally, by Giraldus
Cambrensis, who tells us that the Welsh "Adeo fidei fœdus,
aliis inviolabile gentibus, parvipendere solent, ut non in seriis
solum et necessariis, verum in ludicris, omnique fere verbo
firmando, <i>dextræ manus ut mos est porrectione, signo usuali dato</i>,
fidem gratis effundere consueverint." Here the point of the
complaint is that they made light of this solemn practice,
indulging in it freely on every occasion instead of reserving it
for important matters. The existence of this archaic "fidei
fœdus" as the <i>formal confirmation</i> of a contract is, of course,
of the greatest interest. It still lingers on, not only with us,
but abroad. In San Marino (Italy), for instance, "sales are
conducted with much animation. Two sturdy proprietors
stand back to back.... A third party stands between the
two; ... he pulls one by the shoulder, the other by an elbow,
and finally by an apparently acrobatic feat <i>he unites their
hands</i>" ("A Political Survival," <i>Macmillan's</i>, January, 1891, p.
197). In the Lebanon, we are told by a well-informed writer:
"A few months ago I had occasion to enter into a business
contract with one of my Druse farmers. When we were about
to draw up the agreement, the Druse suggested that, as he
could neither read nor write, we should ratify the bargain in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">{387}</a></span>
the manner customary among his people. This consists of a
solemn grasping of hands together in the presence of two or
three other Druses as witnesses, whilst the agreement is recited
by both parties.... Accordingly, the farmer brought three
of his neighbours to me; and the terms of our contract having
been made known to them, one of them took the right hand of
each of us and joined them together, whilst he dictated to us
what to say after him" ("The Druses," <i>Blackwood's</i>, January,
1891, pp. 754, 755). With us, Gerald would be grieved to
hear, the ancient form survives not only for the bargain but
the bet, though it only continues in full vigour as the sign of
the marriage contract, where "the minister ... shall cause
the man with his right hand to take the woman by her right
hand, and to say after him as followeth,"—even as the Druses,
we have seen, make their contracts to-day, and as the Empress
Maud sealed her own seven centuries ago.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>The allusion by the Empress to the "Christianitas Angliæ"
refers doubtless to the fact that the breach of such "affidatio"
would constitute a "læsio fidei," and would thus become a
matter for the jurisdiction of the courts Christian. It was
indeed on this plea that these courts claimed to attract to
themselves all cases of contract, a claim against which, it is
necessary to explain, an article (No. 15) of the Constitutions
of Clarendon (1164) was specially directed.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
confusion on the pedigree and relationship of these two
families is due, in the first place, to the fact that, for several
generations, the successive heads of the family of De Vere
were all named Aubrey ("Albericus"); and in the second, to
a chronicle of Walden Abbey, which proves as inaccurate as to
the marriage of its founder as it is on the date of his creation.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1121" id="Ref_1121" href="#Foot_1121">[1121]</a></span>
Dugdale, accepting all its statements without the slightest
hesitation, has combined in a single passage no less than three
errors, together with the means for their detection.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1122" id="Ref_1122" href="#Foot_1122">[1122]</a></span> Among
these is the statement that Geoffrey's wife was a daughter of
Aubrey de Vere, "Earl of Oxford."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1123" id="Ref_1123" href="#Foot_1123">[1123]</a></span> Accordingly, she so
figures in Dugdale's tabular pedigree, and the same error has
now reappeared in Mr. Doyle's <i>Official Baronage</i>.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1124" id="Ref_1124" href="#Foot_1124">[1124]</a></span> Oddly
enough, in his account of the De Veres, a few pages before,
Dugdale makes Geoffrey's wife daughter not of the Earl of
Oxford, but of his grandfather Aubrey,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1125" id="Ref_1125" href="#Foot_1125">[1125]</a></span> and so enters her in
the tabular pedigree.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1126" id="Ref_1126" href="#Foot_1126">[1126]</a></span> And yet she was, in truth, daughter
neither of the earl nor of his grandfather, but of his father,
the chamberlain.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1127" id="Ref_1127" href="#Foot_1127">[1127]</a></span> To establish this will now be my task.</p>

<p>Between the Aubrey de Vere of Domesday and the Aubrey
de Vere "senior" of the <i>Cartulary of Abingdon Abbey</i>, about
twenty years are interposed. Their identity, therefore, is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">{389}</a></span>
actually proved, though the presumption, of course, is in its
favour. But from the time of the latter Aubrey all is clear.
The descent that we obtain from the Abingdon Cartulary is as
follows:—</p>

<pre>

                        Aubrey   =  Beatrice,
                        de Vere,  |

                "camerarius                              father.
                   Regis"),
                  d. 1141.

</pre>

<p>Our next source of information is the <i>Cartulary of Colne
Priory</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1128" id="Ref_1128" href="#Foot_1128">[1128]</a></span> in combination with an invaluable tract, <i>De miraculis
S. Osythæ</i>, composed by William de Vere, a brother of the first
earl, and a canon of St. Osyth's Priory, Essex. Dugdale was
acquainted with both documents, but lost the full force of the
latter by failing to identify its author. He gives us as sons
to Aubrey the chamberlain, and brothers to Aubrey the first
earl, (<i>a</i>) William de Vere, (<i>b</i>) —— de Vere, canon of St.
Osyth's. The identity of the two is proved, first, by a charter
of Aubrey the chamberlain, in which he speaks of his "reverend"
son William;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1129" id="Ref_1129" href="#Foot_1129">[1129]</a></span> secondly, by a charter of Aubrey the
earl, witnessed by his brother William, "presbyter;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1130" id="Ref_1130" href="#Foot_1130">[1130]</a></span> thirdly,
by the charter from the Empress to the earl, in which she
provides for all his brothers, the chancellorship, a clerical post,
being promised to William.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1131" id="Ref_1131" href="#Foot_1131">[1131]</a></span> We may further assert of this tract
that it must have been written after 1163, for the canon tells
us that his mother has spent her twenty-two years of widowhood
at St. Osyth, and her husband had been killed in 1141.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1132" id="Ref_1132" href="#Foot_1132">[1132]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">{390}</a></span>
In it he refers to his father the chamberlain,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1133" id="Ref_1133" href="#Foot_1133">[1133]</a></span> as "justitiarius
totius Angliæ." To this we may trace Dugdale's assertion
that he held that high office, a statement which exercised
the mind of Foss, who complains that "it is difficult to tell on
what authority" he is introduced among its holders both by
Dugdale and Spelman.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1134" id="Ref_1134" href="#Foot_1134">[1134]</a></span> He further speaks of his mother as
"Adeliza," daughter of Gilbert de Clare, and exults in the fact
that she has spent her widowhood, not in the family priory at
Colne, but in that of his own St. Osyth. He refers also to his
sister "Adeliza de Essexâ filia Alberici de Vere et Adelizæ."
Now, we have abundant evidence that "Adeliza de Essex" was
sister to the Countess Rohese, wife of Geoffrey de Mandeville,
and was aunt to their sons, Earls of Essex.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1135" id="Ref_1135" href="#Foot_1135">[1135]</a></span> Accordingly, we
find the Countess Rohese giving a rent-charge to Colne Priory
for the souls of her father, Aubrey de Vere, and her husband,
Earl Geoffrey, and we also find her son, Earl William, confirming
the charter "avi mei Alberici de Vere."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1136" id="Ref_1136" href="#Foot_1136">[1136]</a></span> It is quite clear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">{391}</a></span>
that the Countess Rohese, wife of Geoffrey de Mandeville, first
Earl of Essex, was sister of Alice "de Essex," and daughter of
Aubrey de Vere the chamberlain, by his wife Alice, daughter of
Gilbert de Clare.</p>

<p>But who was Alice "de Essex"? We must turn, for an
answer to this question, to the <i>Chronicle of Walden Abbey</i>.
There we shall find that she married twice, and left issue by
both husbands. Her first husband was Robert de Essex<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1137" id="Ref_1137" href="#Foot_1137">[1137]</a></span>; her
second was Roger fitz Richard, of Clavering, Essex, and Warkworth,
Northumberland, ancestor of the Claverings. Now,
"Robert de Essex" was a well-known man, being son and heir
of Swegen de Essex, Sheriff of Essex under William the Conqueror,
and grandson of Robert "fitz Wimarc," a favourite of
the Confessor, under whom he, too, was Sheriff of Essex. The
descent is proved, in a conclusive manner, by the description
of the second Robert among the benefactors to Lewes Priory,
in one place as Robert fitz Suein, and in another as Robert de
Essex.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1138" id="Ref_1138" href="#Foot_1138">[1138]</a></span> Robert had founded Prittlewell Priory as a cell to
Lewes, "Alberico de Ver et Roberto fratre ejus" attesting the
foundation charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1139" id="Ref_1139" href="#Foot_1139">[1139]</a></span> Robert's son and heir was the well-known
Henry de Essex.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1140" id="Ref_1140" href="#Foot_1140">[1140]</a></span> So far all is clear. But, unfortunately, it
is certain that Robert de Essex left a widow, Gunnor—a Bigod
by birth—who was mother of his son Henry. Therefore
"Alice of Essex" cannot have been his widow. Consequently
she must have been the widow of another Robert de Essex,
possibly a younger son of his, who held Clavering from his
elder brother Henry. In any case, by her second husband,
Roger fitz Richard, Alice was mother of Robert fitz Roger (of
Clavering).</p>

<p>We are now in a position to construct an authentic tabular
pedigree, showing the relationship that existed between the
families of Mandeville and De Vere.</p>

<p>It should be observed that this pedigree is not intended to
show all the children. It gives those only which are required
for our special purpose. On some points there is still need of
more original information. No doubt Beatrice, wife of William
de Say, was sister, and not daughter, to Geoffrey de Mandeville.
I know of nothing to the contrary. Still the fact would
seem to rest on the authority of the <i>Walden Chronicle</i>. The
re-marriage of the Countess of Essex to Payn de Beauchamp,
and her parentage, by him, of Simon, are both well established,
but the date of her death is taken from the <i>Chronicle</i>, and seems
suspiciously late. So also does that which is assigned to her
brother, the Earl of Oxford, namely, 1194, fifty-two years after
the charter of the Empress. Still, the fact that his mother
survived her husband for twenty-two years implies that her
children may have been comparatively young at his death.
Both Aubrey and Rohese may therefore have been several
years junior to Geoffrey de Mandeville.</p>

<p>But the main point has been, in any case, established,
namely, the true relationship of these baronial houses. That
which is given by Dugdale contains the further error of representing
Alice de Vere as wife, not of Robert de Essex, but
of Henry. Mr. W. S. Ellis, in his <i>Antiquities of Heraldry</i>
(p. 210), observes with truth that, as to this relationship, the
existing "accounts ... are conflicting, and that of Dugdale
contradictory." But I cannot admit that his own version is
"correct, or approximately so;" for while, with Dugdale, he
errs in assigning to Alice de Vere Henry de Essex for husband,
he transforms Roger fitz Richard, whom Dugdale had, rightly,
given as her second husband, into her son-in-law.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1141" id="Ref_1141" href="#Foot_1141">[1141]</a></span></p>

<p>My reason for alluding to this passage is that, after I had
worked out the heraldic corollaries of this descent in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">{394}</a></span>
bearing on the adoption of coat-armour, I found that I had
been anticipated in this investigation by the author of that
scholarly work, <i>The Antiquities of Heraldry</i>. As the conclusions,
however, at which I had arrived differ slightly from
those of Mr. Ellis, it may be worth while to set them forth.</p>

<p>Mr. Ellis writes thus of "the simple <small>QUARTERLY</small> shield":—</p>

<p class="small">"There can be little doubt that the source of this honoured armorial ensign
is to be found in the distinguished family of <span class="smc">De Vere</span>, as all the families in
the table who bear it are descended from the head of that house who lived
at the commencement of the twelfth century."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1142" id="Ref_1142" href="#Foot_1142">[1142]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">I should differ with no slight hesitation from so ably argued
and erudite a work, were it not that, in this case, its conclusions
are based on a false premiss. Thus we read, further
on:—</p>

<p class="small">"Which was the original bearer of the quarterly coat of De Vere? Was it
Say, or Mandeville, or Lacy, or Beauchamp, or was it De Vere, from whom
all, or their wives were descended?"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1143" id="Ref_1143" href="#Foot_1143">[1143]</a></span></p>

<p class="nodent">Now, "the table" given by the writer himself (p. 210) disproves
this statement, for it rightly shows us Say as descended
from Mandeville, but <i>not</i> descended from De Vere. It is,
therefore, shown by his own "table" that this <i>must</i> have been
a case of the "collateral adoption" of arms, the very practice
against which he here strenuously argues.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1144" id="Ref_1144" href="#Foot_1144">[1144]</a></span> Thus the very
case he adduces against the existence of the practice is itself
proof absolute that the practice did exist. I am compelled to
emphasize this point because it is the pivot on which the
question turns. If "all the families in the table" who bore
the quarterly coat were indeed descended from De Vere, Mr.
Ellis's theory would account for the facts. But, by his own
showing, they were not. Some other explanation must therefore
be sought.</p>

<p>That which had originally occurred to myself, and to which
I am still compelled to adhere, is that "the original bearer"
of this quarterly coat was the central figure of this family
group, Geoffrey de Mandeville himself. It being, as I have
shown, absolutely clear that there must have been collateral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">{395}</a></span>
adoption, the only question that remains to be decided is from
which of the two family stems, Mandeville or De Vere, was
the coat adopted? My first reason for selecting the former
is that the first Earl of Essex was far and away, at the time,
the greatest personage of the group. Aubrey de Vere figures,
at Oxford, as his dependant rather than as his equal. On this
ground, then, it seems to me far more probable that Aubrey
should have adopted his arms from Geoffrey than that Geoffrey
should have adopted his from Aubrey. The second reason is
this. Science and analogy point to the fact that the simplest
form of the coat is, of necessity, the most original. Now, the
simplest form of this coat, its only "undifferenced" variety,
is that borne by the Earls of Essex. We do not obtain recorded
blazons till the reign of Henry III., but when we do, it is as
"quartele de or &amp; de goulez" that the coat of the Earl of
Essex, the namesake of Geoffrey de Mandeville, first meets us.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1145" id="Ref_1145" href="#Foot_1145">[1145]</a></span>
But all the descendants of De Vere, it would seem, bear this
coat "differenced," that of De Vere itself being charged with a
mullet in the first quarter, the tinctures also (perhaps for distinction)
being in this case reversed.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1146" id="Ref_1146" href="#Foot_1146">[1146]</a></span> Thus heraldry, as well
as genealogy, favours the claim of Mandeville as the original
bearer of the coat.</p>

<p>It has been generally asserted in works on Heraldry that
Geoffrey de Mandeville added an escarbuncle to his simple
paternal coat, and that it is still to be seen on the shield of
his effigy among the monuments at the Temple Church. But
antiquaries have now abandoned the belief that this is indeed
his effigy, and the original statement is taken only from that
<i>Chronicle of Walden</i> which is in error in its statements on his
foundation, on his creation, on his marriage, and on his death.
Nor is there a trace of such a charge on the shields of any of
his heirs.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1147" id="Ref_1147" href="#Foot_1147">[1147]</a></span></p>

<p>But the consequences of the theory here laid down have yet
to be considered. A little thought will soon show that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">{396}</a></span>
hypothesis can possibly explain the adoption of the quarterly
coat by these various families at any other period than this
in which they all intermarried. If we wish to trace to its
origin such a surname as Fitz-Walter, we must go back to
some ancestor who had a Walter for his father. So with
derivative coats-of-arms. By Mr. Ellis's fundamental principle
we ought to find the house of De Vere imparting its coat, for
successive generations, to those families who were privileged
to ally themselves to it. Yet we can only trace this principle
at work in this particular generation. If Mandeville, and
Mandeville's kin, adopted, as he holds, the coat of De Vere,
why should not De Vere, in the previous generation, have
adopted that of Clare? Nothing, in short, can account for
the phenomena except the hypothesis that these quarterly coats
all originated in this generation and in consequence of these
intermarriages. The quarterly coat of the great earl would
be adopted by his sister's husband De Say, and by his wife's
brother De Vere, and by those other relatives shown in the
pedigree. Once adopted they remain, till they meet us in the
recorded blazons of the reign of Henry III.</p>

<p>The natural inference from this conclusion is that the reign
of Stephen was the period in which heraldic bearings were
assuming a definite form. Most heralds would place it later:
Mr. Ellis would have us believe that we ought to place it
earlier. The question has been long and keenly discussed,
and, as with surnames, we may not be able to give with certainty
the date at which they became generally fixed. But, at any
rate, in this typical case, the facts admit of one explanation
and of one alone.</p>

<p>If, as I take it, heraldic coats were mainly intended (as at
Evesham) to distinguish their bearers in the field, it is not
improbable that these kindred coats may represent the alliance
of their bearers, as typified in the Oxford charters, beneath
the banner of the Earl of Essex.<span class="fnanchor"><a

It would seem clear that this William must have been the "Dominus
Willelmus de Ver" to whom Dr. Stubbs alludes as the "early friend and
fellow-student," at the University of Paris, of Arnulf, Bishop of Lisieux,
and of the celebrated Ralf "de Diceto" (who may have been born, Dr.
Stubbs suggests, about 1122). Bishop Arnulf, asking Ralf to come over
and pay him a visit, tells him that William de Ver has promised to come too
(see preface to <i>Radulfus de Diceto</i>, pp. xxxii., <i>note</i>, liv.). But some difficulty
is caused by his appearing as a canon, not of St. Osyth's, but of St. Paul's,
in 1162 and later (<i>Ninth Report Historical MSS.</i>, App. i. pp. 19 <i>a</i>, 32 <i>a</i>). It
would seem to have been the latter William de Ver who became Bishop of
Hereford in 1185, and died 1199.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_1133" id="Foot_1133" href="#Ref_1133">[1133]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
He had received the "Cameraria Angliæ" from Henry I., in a charter
which must have passed on the occasion of the king leaving England for the
last time in 1133. Madox has printed the charter (which has a valuable list
of witnesses) in his <i>Baronia Anglica</i>, from Dugdale's transcript.</p>

Thus the <i>Chronicle of Walden Abbey</i> (<i>Arundel MSS.</i>) relates that at the
death of Geoffrey, Earl of Essex, in 1166, his mother was living at her Priory
of Chicksand, with her sister "Adeliza" of Essex. On the succession of his
brother William, "Alicia de Essexia" came to Walden Abbey "ordinante
comite Willelmo ejus nepote," and settled and died there (<i>ibid.</i>, cap. 18).
But the most important evidence is a charter of this same Earl William,
abstracted in <i>Lansdowne MSS.</i>, 259, fol. 67, granting to "Adelicia of Essex,"
his mother's sister, the town of Aynho in free dower over and above the
dower she had received from Roger fitz Richard, her lord. This charter is
witnessed by his mother, "Roesia Comitissa;" Simon de Beauchamp, his
uterine brother; Geoffrey de Ver and William de Ver, his uncles; Ranulf
Glanville, and Geoffrey de Say, who was his cousin. He had previously
granted Aynho (? in 1170) to Roger fitz Richard in exchange for Compton
(co. Warwick), his charter being witnessed <i>inter alios</i> by John (de Lacy), the
constable of Chester (see p. 392 <i>n.</i>), Ranulf de Glanville, and Geoffrey de Say
(see my paper on "A Charter of William, Earl of Essex," in <i>Eng. Hist.

I have purposely abstained from touching on the relationship of Lacy
to De Vere, because there is evidently error somewhere in the account given
by Dugdale, and as the descent is without my sphere, I have not investigated
the question. The <i>Rotulus de Dominabus</i> should be consulted. Nor do I
discuss the descent of Sackville. Mr. Ellis wrote: "The coat of Sackville,
<i>Quarterly, a bend vairé</i>, is doubtless derived from De Vere, but by what
match does not clearly appear." It is singular that William de Sackville,
who died <i>circa</i> 1158, is said to have married Adeliza, daughter of "Aubrey
the sheriff," which points to some connection between the two families.</p>

I must certainly decline to accept the rash conjecture of Mr. Ellis that
the mullet of De Vere represents the chamberlainship, on the ground that one

<small>ROGER "DE RAMIS."</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_181">181</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
entries relating to the fief of this tenant <i>in capite</i> are
probably as corrupt as any to be found in the <i>Liber Niger</i>.</p>

<p>The name of the family being "de Raimes"—Latinized in
this charter and Domesday invariably as <i>de Ramis</i>—an inevitable
confusion soon arose between it and the name of their
chief seat in England, Rayne, co. Essex. Morant, in his history
of Essex, identifies the two. Thus, Rayne being entered in
Domesday and in the <i>Liber Niger</i> as "Raines," the name of
the family appears in the latter as "de Raines," "de Reines"
(i. 237), "de Ramis," "de Raimis," and "de Raimes" (i. 239,
240). The Domesday tenant was Roger "de Ramis," who was
succeeded by William "de Raimes," who was dead in 1130,
when his sons Roger and Robert are found indebted to the
Crown for their reliefs and for their father's debts (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>,
31 Hen. I.). Further, if the <i>Liber Niger</i> (i. 237, 239) is to
be trusted, there were in 1135 two Essex fiefs, held respectively
by these very sons, Roger and Robert "de Ramis." So far all is
clear. But when we come to the <i>cartæ</i> of 1166 all is hopeless
confusion. There are, certainly, two fiefs entered in the Essex
portion, but while the <i>carta</i> of that which is assigned to Robert
"de Ramis" is intelligible, though very corrupt, the other is
assigned by an amazing blunder to William fitz Miles, who was
merely one of the under-tenants. Moreover, the entries are so
similar that they might be easily taken for variants of the same
<i>carta</i>.</p>

<p>Let us, however, now turn to the Pipe-Roll of 1159 (5
Hen. II.). We there find these entries (p. 5) under Essex:—</p>

<p class="small">"Idem vicecomes reddit Compotum de <small>XII</small> <i>l.</i> et <small>XIII</small> <i>s.</i> et <small>IIII</small> <i>d.</i> pro Rogero
de Ram'.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">{400}</a></div>

<p class="small">"Idem vicecomes reddit Compotum de <small>XII</small> <i>l.</i> et <small>XIII</small> <i>s.</i> <small>IIII</small> <i>d.</i> pro Ricardo
de Ram'."</p>

<p>They require some explanation. The sums here accounted for
(though it is not so stated) are payments towards "the great
scutage" of the year at two marks on the knight's fee. These
were in most cases paid collectively by the aggregate of knights
liable. Here, luckily for us, these two tenants paid separately.
Turning the payments into marcs, and then dividing by two,
we find that each represents an assessment of nine and a half
knights. Now, we know for certain from the <i>Liber Niger</i>
(i. 240) that the assessment of one of these two fiefs was ten
knights, and that its holder was entitled to deduct from that
assessment an amount equivalent to half a knight. For such
is the meaning in the language of the Exchequer of the phrase:
"feodum dimidii militis ... <i>quod mihi computatur</i> in <small>X</small> militibus
quos Regi debeo." Thus we obtain the exact amount
(nine and a half knights) on which he pays in the above Roll.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1150" id="Ref_1150" href="#Foot_1150">[1150]</a></span></p>

<p>But we can go further still. Each of the two fiefs was
entitled to the same deduction (<i>Liber Niger</i>). Both, therefore,
must have been alike assessed at ten knights. We are now on
the right track. These two fiefs in the <i>Liber Niger</i> are not
identical but distinct; they represent an original fief, assessed
at twenty knights, which has been divided into two equal
halves, each with an assessment of ten knights. And as with
the whole fief, so with some of its component parts. Dedham,
for instance, the "Delham" of Domesday (ii. 83) and the
"Diham" of our charter, was held of the lord of the fief by
the service of one knight. When the fief was divided in two,
Dedham was divided too. Accordingly, we find it mentioned in
our charter (1142) as "Diham que fuit Rogeri de Ramis,
rectum ... fili<i>orum</i> Rogeri de Ramis." It was their joint
right, because it was divided between them, just as it still
appears divided in the <i>cartæ</i> of 1166.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1151" id="Ref_1151" href="#Foot_1151">[1151]</a></span></p>

<p>But further, why is Dedham alone mentioned in this charter?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">{401}</a></span>
Because it was that portion of the fief which the Crown had
seized and kept, and consequently that of which the restoration
was now exacted from the Empress. And why had the Crown
seized it? Possibly as security for those very debts, which were
due to it from William "de Raimes" (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 31 Hen. I.).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1152" id="Ref_1152" href="#Foot_1152">[1152]</a></span></p>

<p>Dedham was not the only divided manor in the fief.
"Totintuna," in Norfolk, was similarly shared, its one knight's
fee being halved. This enables us to correct an error in the
<i>Liber Niger</i>. We there read (i. 237)—</p>

<div class="poetry-fn">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse quote1">"Warinus de Totinton' medietatem <small>I</small> militis."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And again (i. 239)—</p>

<div class="poetry-fn">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse quote1">"Warinus dim' mil'.</div>
<div class="verse">De Todinton' feodum dimidii militis."</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the latter case the right reading is—</p>

<div class="poetry-fn">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse quote1">"Warinus de Todinton' dim' mil'.</div>
<div class="verse">Feodum dimidii militis<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1153" id="Ref_1153" href="#Foot_1153">[1153]</a></span> de Hiham, quod," etc.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Further, Robert "de Reines" is returned in both <i>cartæ</i> as
holding (1166) a quarter of a knight's fee in each fief, "de
novo fefamento," apparently in Higham (Suffolk), not far from
Dedham (Essex). This suggests his enfeofment by the service
of half a knight, and the division of his holding when the fief
was divided. It is strange that on the Roll of 1159 he is
entered as paying one marc, which would be the exact amount
payable for half a knight.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1154" id="Ref_1154" href="#Foot_1154">[1154]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the main points have been satisfactorily established.
The genealogy is not so easy. Our charter tells us that, in
1142, the sons of Roger "de Ramis" were the "nepotes" of
Earl Aubrey. From the earl's age at the time they could not
be his grandsons: they were, therefore, his nephews, the sons
of a sister. Were they the Richard and Roger who, in 1159,
held respectively the two halves of the original fief (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>,
5 Hen. II.)? To answer this question, we must grasp the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">{402}</a></span>
<i>data</i> clearly. In 1130 and in 1135 the two fiefs were respectively
held by Robert and Roger, the sons of <i>William</i>. In our
charter (1142) we find them, it would seem, held by "the sons
of <i>Roger</i>," probably of tender years. This would suggest that
the Robert (son of William) of 1135 had died childless before
1142, and that his fief had been reunited to that of his brother
Roger, only, however, for the joint fief to be again divided
between Roger's sons. But the question is further complicated
by some documents relating to the church of Ardleigh, one of
which is addressed by "Robertus de Ramis filius Rogeri de
Ramis" to Robert [de Sigillo], Bishop of London, while another,
addressed to the same bishop, proceeds from Robert son of
<i>William</i> "de Ramis," apparently his uncle. In 1159 the two
fiefs reappear as held respectively by Roger and Richard "de
Ramis." In 1165 (<i>Rot. Pip.</i>, 11 Hen. II.) we find them held
by William and Richard de Ramis, and thenceforth they were
always known as the fiefs of William and of Richard. The
actual names of the holders of the fiefs in 1166 (one of which
is ignored by the Black Book and the other given as Robert)
are determined by the Pipe-Roll of 1168, where they are
entered as William and Richard. Thus, at length, we ascertain
that the <i>carta</i> assigned to William "filius Milonis" was in
truth that of William "de Ramis," while that which is assigned
to Robert "de Ramis" was in truth that of Richard "de
Ramis." The entry on this Pipe-Roll relating to the latter
fief throws so important a light on the <i>Carta</i> of 1166, that I
here print the two side by side.</p>

If, as implied by our charter, the sons of Roger ("de
Ramis") were minors at the time of the Anarchy, this would
account for Earl Hugh seizing, as recorded in William's <i>carta</i>,
five of his knights' fees in the time of King Stephen (<i>Liber
Niger</i>, i. 237).</p>

<p>The later history of these two fiefs is one of some complexity,
but the descent of Dedham, which alone concerns our
own charter, is fortunately quite clear. Its two halves are well
shown in the <i>Testa de Nevill</i> entry:—</p>

<p class="small">"Leonia de Stutevill tenet feodum unius militia in Byh[a]m unde debet
facere unam medietatem heredi Ricardi de Reymes et alteram medietatem
heredi Willelmi de Reymes" (i. 276).</p>

<p>For this Byham, improbable as it may seem, was really the
"Diham" of our charter, <i>i.e.</i> Dedham, and the two halves of
the original barony are here described (as I explained above)
as those of Richard and William. In a survey of Richard's
portion of the fief among the inquisitions of John (<i>circ.</i> 1212),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1156" id="Ref_1156" href="#Foot_1156">[1156]</a></span>
we find Leonia holding half a knight's fee in "Dyham" of it,
and in a later inquisition we find her heir, John de Stuteville,
holding the estate as "Dyhale" (<i>Testa</i>, p. 281 <i>b</i>). As early as
1185-86 Leonia was already in possession of Dedham, as will
be seen by the extract below from the <i>Rotulus de Dominabus</i>.
This entry is one of a series which have formed the subject of
keen, and even hot, discussion. The fact that Dedham is
spoken of here as her "inheritance" has led to the hasty
inference that she was heiress, or co-heiress, to the Raimes fief.
This view seems to have been started by Mr. E. Chester Waters
in a communication to <i>Notes and Queries</i> (1872),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1157" id="Ref_1157" href="#Foot_1157">[1157]</a></span> in which, on
the strength of the entries below relating to her and to Alice
de Tani, he drew out a pedigree deriving them both from the
"Roger de Ramis of Domesday." Writing to the <i>Academy</i> in
1885, he took great credit to himself for his performance in
<i>Notes and Queries</i>, and observed, of Mr. Yeatman: "I must
refer him to the <i>Rotulus de Dominabus</i> and to the Chartulary
of Bocherville Abbey for the true co-heirs of the fief of
Raimes."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1158" id="Ref_1158" href="#Foot_1158">[1158]</a></span> But the extracts which follow clearly show (when
combined with the <i>Testa</i> entry above) that neither Leonia nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">{404}</a></span>
Alice were the "true co-heirs of the fief of Raimes," for they
were merely under-tenants of that fief, Leonia holding one
knight's fee from the tenants of the whole fief, and Alice two
knights' fees from the tenants of Richard's portion.</p>

<p>Leonia is indeed stated to be "de progenie Rogeri de
Reimes," and so is the heir of Alice (<i>not</i>, as alleged, Alice
herself), but there is nothing to show that this was the Roger
de Raimes "of Domesday." It may have been his namesake
(and grandson?) of 1130-35, or even (though probably not)
the Roger of 1159. Whether the allusion, in our charter (1142),
to Dedham being the "rectum" of the sons of Roger de Ramis,
and the fact of its being in the king's hands then and in
1166-68, had to do with a claim by Leonia or her mother, or
not, it is obvious that Leonia did not claim, nor did Alice de
Tani, to be, in any sense, the heir of either of the above Rogers,
though she may have been, as was the case so often with
under-tenants, connected with them in blood.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX Y.<br />
<small>THE FIRST AND SECOND VISITS OF HENRY II. TO ENGLAND.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_198">198</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
dates and circumstances of these two visits are a subject
of some importance and interest. Fortunately, they can be
accurately ascertained.</p>

<p>It is certain that, on Henry's first visit, he landed with
his uncle at Wareham towards the close of 1142. Stephen had
been besieging the Empress in Oxford since the 26th of
September,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1159" id="Ref_1159" href="#Foot_1159">[1159]</a></span> and her brother, recalled to England by her
danger, must have landed, with Henry, about the beginning
of December, for she had then been besieged more than two
months, and Christmas was at hand.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1160" id="Ref_1160" href="#Foot_1160">[1160]</a></span> This date is confirmed
by another calculation. For the earl, on landing, we are told,
laid siege to the castle of Wareham, and took it, after three
weeks.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1161" id="Ref_1161" href="#Foot_1161">[1161]</a></span> But as the flight of the Empress from Oxford coincided
with, or followed immediately after, his capture of the castle,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1162" id="Ref_1162" href="#Foot_1162">[1162]</a></span>
and as that flight took place on the eve of Christmas,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1163" id="Ref_1163" href="#Foot_1163">[1163]</a></span> after a
siege of three months,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1164" id="Ref_1164" href="#Foot_1164">[1164]</a></span> this would similarly throw back the
landing of the earl at Wareham to the beginning of December
(1142).</p>

<p>By a strange oversight, Dr. Stubbs, the supreme authority
on his life, makes Henry arrive in 1141, "when he was eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">{406}</a></span>
years old, to be trained in arms;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1165" id="Ref_1165" href="#Foot_1165">[1165]</a></span> whereas, as we have seen,
he did not arrive till towards the end of 1142, when he was
nine years and three-quarters old. Nor, it would seem, was
there any intention that he should be then trained in arms.
This point is here mentioned because it bears on the chronology
of Gervase, as criticised by Dr. Stubbs, who, I venture to
think, may have been thus led to pronounce it, as he does,
"unsound."</p>

<p>On recovering Wareham, Henry and his uncle set out for
Cirencester, where the earl appointed a rendezvous of his party,
with a view to an advance on Oxford. The Empress, however,
in the mean time, unable to hold out any longer, effected her
well-known romantic escape and fled to Wallingford, where
those of her supporters who ought to have been with her
when Stephen assailed her, had gathered round the stronghold
of Brian fitz Count, having decided that their forces were not
equal to raising the siege of Oxford.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1166" id="Ref_1166" href="#Foot_1166">[1166]</a></span> Thither, therefore, the
earl now hastened with his charge, and the Empress, we are
told, forgot all her troubles in the joy of the meeting with
her son.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1167" id="Ref_1167" href="#Foot_1167">[1167]</a></span></p>

<p>Stephen had been as eager to relieve his beleaguered
garrison at Wareham as the earl had been, at the same time,
to raise the siege of Oxford. Neither of them, however, would
attempt the task till he had finished the enterprise he had in
hand.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1168" id="Ref_1168" href="#Foot_1168">[1168]</a></span> But now that the fall of Oxford had set Stephen free,
he determined, though Wareham had fallen, that he would at
least regain possession.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1169" id="Ref_1169" href="#Foot_1169">[1169]</a></span> But the earl had profited, it seems,
by his experience of the preceding year, and Stephen found
the fortress was now too strong for him.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1170" id="Ref_1170" href="#Foot_1170">[1170]</a></span> He accordingly
revenged himself for this disappointment by ravaging the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">{407}</a></span>
district with fire and sword.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1171" id="Ref_1171" href="#Foot_1171">[1171]</a></span> Thus passed the earlier months
of 1143. Eventually, with his brother, the Bishop of Winchester,
he marched to Wilton, where he proceeded to convert
the nunnery of St. Etheldred into a fortified post, which
should act as a check on the garrison of the Empress
at Salisbury.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1172" id="Ref_1172" href="#Foot_1172">[1172]</a></span> The Earl of Gloucester, on hearing of this,
burst upon his forces in the night, and scattered them in all
directions. Stephen himself had a narrow escape, and the
enemy made a prisoner of William Martel, his minister and
faithful adherent.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1173" id="Ref_1173" href="#Foot_1173">[1173]</a></span> This event is dated by Gervase July 1
(1143).</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in dealing with this episode
because, as Dr. Stubbs rightly observes, "the chronology of
Gervase is here quite irreconcilable with that of Henry of
Huntingdon, who places the capture of William Martel in
1142."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1174" id="Ref_1174" href="#Foot_1174">[1174]</a></span> But a careful collation of Gervase's narrative with that
given in the <i>Gesta</i> removes all doubt as to the date, for it is
certain, from the sequence of events in 1142, that at no period
of that year can Stephen and the Earl of Gloucester have been
in Wiltshire at the same time. There is, therefore, no question
that the two detailed narratives I have referred to are right in
assigning the event to 1143, and that Henry of Huntingdon,
who only mentions it briefly, has placed it under a wrong date,
having doubtless confused the two attacks (1142 and 1143) that
Stephen made on Wareham.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1175" id="Ref_1175" href="#Foot_1175">[1175]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry, says Gervase (i. 131), now spent four years in
England, during which he remained at Bristol under the wing
of his mighty uncle, by whom his education was entrusted to
a certain Master Mathew.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1176" id="Ref_1176" href="#Foot_1176">[1176]</a></span> A curious reference by Henry himself
to this period of his life will be found in the <i>Monasticon</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">{408}</a></span>
(vol. vi.), where, in a charter (? 1153) to St. Augustine's,
Bristol, he refers to that abbey as one</p>

<p class="small">"quam inicio juventutis meæ beneficiis et protectione cœpi juvare et
fovere."</p>

<p>It should be noticed that Gervase twice refers to Henry's
stay as one of four years (i. 125, 133), and that this statement
is strictly in harmony with those by which it is succeeded.
Dr. Stubbs admits that Henry's departure is placed by him "at
the end of 1146,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1177" id="Ref_1177" href="#Foot_1177">[1177]</a></span> and this would be exactly four years from
the date when, as we saw, he landed. Again, Gervase goes on
to state that two years and four months elapsed before his
return.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1178" id="Ref_1178" href="#Foot_1178">[1178]</a></span> This would bring us to April, 1149; and "here," as
Dr. Stubbs observes, "we get a certain date," for "Henry was
certainly knighted at Carlisle at Whitsuntide [May 22],
1149."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1179" id="Ref_1179" href="#Foot_1179">[1179]</a></span> It will be seen then that the chronology of Gervase
is thoroughly consistent throughout.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1180" id="Ref_1180" href="#Foot_1180">[1180]</a></span> When Dr. Stubbs
writes: "Gervase's chronology is evidently unsound here, but
the sequence of events is really obscure,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1181" id="Ref_1181" href="#Foot_1181">[1181]</a></span> he alludes to the
mention of the Earl of Gloucester's death. But it will be
found, on reference to the passage, that its meaning is quite
clear, namely, that the earl died during Henry's absence
(<i>interea</i>), and in the November after his departure. And such
was, admittedly, the case.</p>

<p>The second visit of Henry to England has scarcely obtained
the attention it deserved. It was fully intended, I believe, at
the time, that his arrival should give the signal for a renewal
of the civil war. This is, by Gervase (i. 140), distinctly
implied. He also tells us that it was now that Henry abandoned
his studies to devote himself to arms.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1182" id="Ref_1182" href="#Foot_1182">[1182]</a></span> It would seem, however,
to be generally supposed that the sole incident of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">{409}</a></span>
visit was his receiving knighthood from his great-uncle, the
King of Scots, at Carlisle. But it is at Devizes that he first
appears, charter evidence informing us of the fact that he was
there, surrounded by some leading partisans, on April 13.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1183" id="Ref_1183" href="#Foot_1183">[1183]</a></span>
Again, it has, apparently, escaped notice that the author of the
<i>Gesta</i>, at some length, refers to this second visit (pp. 127-129).
His editor, at least, supposed him to be referring to Henry's
<i>first</i> (1142) and <i>third</i> (1153) visits; these, in that gentleman's
opinion, being evidently one and the same.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1184" id="Ref_1184" href="#Foot_1184">[1184]</a></span> According to
the <i>Gesta</i>, Henry began by attacking the royal garrisons in
Cricklade and Bourton, which would harmonize, it will be seen,
exactly with a northerly advance from Devizes. He was, however,
unsuccessful in these attempts. Among those who joined
him, says Gervase, were the Earls of Hereford and of Chester.
The former duly appears with him at Devizes in the charter to
which I have referred; the latter is mentioned by John of
Hexham as being present with him at Carlisle.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1185" id="Ref_1185" href="#Foot_1185">[1185]</a></span> This brings
us to the strange story, told by the author of the <i>Gesta</i>, that
Henry, before long, deserted by his friends, was forced to appeal
to Stephen for supplies. There is this much to be said in
favour of the story, namely, that the Earl of Chester did play
him false.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1186" id="Ref_1186" href="#Foot_1186">[1186]</a></span> Moreover, the Earl of Gloucester, who is said to
have refused to help him,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1187" id="Ref_1187" href="#Foot_1187">[1187]</a></span> certainly does not appear as taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">{410}</a></span>
any steps on his behalf. Lastly, it is not impossible that
Stephen, whose generosity, in thus acting, is so highly extolled
by the writer, may have taken advantage of Henry's trouble,
to send him supplies on the condition that he should abandon
his enterprise and depart. It is, in any case, certain that he
did depart at the commencement of the following year (1150).<span class="fnanchor"><a

See his note to p. 127. Since the above passage was written, Mr. Howlett's
valuable edition of the <i>Gesta</i> for the Rolls Series has been published, in
which he advances, with great confidence, the view that we are indebted to
its "careful author" for the knowledge of an invasion of England by Henry
fitz Empress in 1147, "unrecorded by any other chronicler" (Chronicles:
<i>Stephen, Henry II., Richard I.</i>, III., xvi.-xx. 130; IV., xxi., xxii.). I have discussed
and rejected this theory in the <i>English Historical Review</i>, October,
1890 (v. 747-750).</p>

<small>BISHOP NIGEL AT ROME.</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_209">209</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">A most</span>
interesting and instructive series of papal letters is
preserved in the valuable Cotton MS. known as Tiberius, A. vi.
The earliest with which we are here concerned are those referred
to in the <i>Historia Eliensis</i> as obtained by Alexander and his
fellows, the "nuncii" of Nigel to the pope, in virtue of which
the bishop regained his see in 1142 (<i>ante</i>, p. 162).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1189" id="Ref_1189" href="#Foot_1189">[1189]</a></span> These
letters are dated April 29. As the bishop was driven from the
see early in 1140, the year to which they belong is not, at first
sight, obvious. The <i>Historia</i> indeed appears to place them just
before his return, but its narrative is not so clear as could be
wished, nor would it imply that the bishop returned so late as
May (1142). The sequence of events I take to have been this.
Nigel, when ejected from his see (1140), fled to the Empress at
Gloucester. There he remained till her triumph in the following
year (1141). He would then, of course, regain his see,
and this would account for his knights being found in possession
of the isle when Stephen recovered his throne. The king,
eager to reassert his rights and to avoid another fenland revolt,
would send the two earls to Ely (1142) to regain possession of
its strongholds. The bishop, now once more an exile, and
despairing of Maud's fortunes, would turn for help to the
pope, and obtain from him these letters commanding his
restoration to his see. I should therefore assign them to
April 29, 1142. This would account for the expression "per
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">{412}</a></span>
longa tempora" in the letter to Stephen. They could not
belong to 1141, when the Empress was in power, and the above
expression would not be applicable in the year 1140.</p>

<p>The following is the gist of the letter to Stephen:—</p>

<p class="small">"Serenitati tue rogando mandamus quatinus dignitates et libertates....
Venerabili quoque fratri nostro Nigello eiusdem loci episcopo in recuperandis
possessionibus ecclesie sue injuste distractis consilium et auxilium prebeas.
Nec pro eo quod ecclesia ipsa sua bona jam per longa tempora perdidit,
justitie sue eam sustinere aliquod preiuditium patiaris" (fol. 114).</p>

<p>To his brother, the Bishop of Winchester, Innocent writes
thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Rogando mandamus et mandando precipimus quatinus sententiam
quam venerabilis frater noster Nigellus Elyensis episcopus in eos qui possessiones
ecclesie sue iniuste et per violentiam detinent rationabiliter promulgavit
firmiter observetis et observari per vestras parrochias pariter faciatis"
(fol. 113 <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>A letter (also from the Lateran) of the same date to Nigel
himself excuses his presence and that of the Abbot of Thorney
at a council. A subsequent letter ("data trans Tyberim") of
the 5th of October, addressed to Theobald and the English
bishops, deals with the expulsion and restitution of Nigel, and
insists on his full restoration.</p>

<p>The next series of letters are from Pope Lucius, and belong
to May 24, 1144, being written on the occasion of Nigel's visit
(<i>ante</i>, p. 208). Of these there are five in all. To Stephen
Lucius writes as follows:—</p>

<p class="small">"Venerabilis frater noster Nigellus Elyensis episcopus quamvis quibusdam
criminibus in presentia nostra notatus fuerit, nec tamen convictus neque
confessus est. Unde nos ipsum cum gratia nostra ad sedem propriam
remittentes nobilitati tue mandamus ut eum pro beati Petri et nostra
reverentia honores, diligas, nec ipse sibi vel ecclesie sue iniuriam vel
molestiam inferas nec ab aliis inferri permittas. Si qua etiam ... ab
hominibus tuis ei ablata sunt cum integritate restitui facias" (fol. 117).</p>

<p>The above "crimina" are those referred to in the <i>Historia
Eliensis</i> as brought forward at the Council of London in 1143:—</p>

<p class="small">"Quidam magni autoritatis et prudentiæ visi adversus Dominum Nigellum
Episcopum parati insurrexerunt: illum ante Domini Papæ præsentiam
appellaverunt, sinistra ei objicientes plurima, maxime quod seditiones in
ipso concitaverat regno, et bona Ecclesie sue in milites dissipaverat; aliaque
ei convicia blasphemantes improperabant" (p. 622).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">{413}</a></span>
A second letter of the same date "Ad clerum elyensem
de condempnatione Symonie Vitalis presbyteri" deals with the
case of Vitalis, a priest in Nigel's diocese, who had been sentenced
to deprivation of his living, for simony, and whose
appeal to the Council of London in 1143 had been favourably
received by the legate.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1190" id="Ref_1190" href="#Foot_1190">[1190]</a></span> The pope had himself reheard the case,
and now confirmed Nigel's decision:—</p>

<p class="small">"Dilectis filiis Rodberto Abbati Thorneie et capitulo elyensi salutem
etc. Notum vobis fieri quia iuditium super causa, videlicet symonia, Vitalis
presbyteri in synodo elyensi habitum in nostra presentia discussum est et
retractatum. Quod nos rationabile cognoscentes apostolice sedis auctoritate
firmavimus," etc., etc. (fol. 117).</p>

<p>Then come two letters, also of the same date, one to
Theobald and the English bishops, the other to the Archbishop
of Rouen, both to the same effect, beginning, "Venerabilis
frater noster Nigellus elyensis episcopus ad sedem apostolicam
veniens, nobis conquestus est quod," etc. (fol. 116 <i>b</i>):<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1191" id="Ref_1191" href="#Foot_1191">[1191]</a></span> the fifth
document of the 24th of May (1144) is a general confirmation
to Ely of all its privileges and possessions (fols. 114 <i>b</i>-116 <i>b</i>).</p>

<p>Last of all is the letter referring to Geoffrey de Mandeville,
which must, from internal evidence, have been written in reply
to a letter from Nigel after his return to England (<i>ante</i>, p. 215).</p>

<small>"TENSERIE."</small></h3>

<p class="center small">(See p. <a href="#Page_215">215</a>.)</p>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">The</span>
mention of "tenseriæ" in the letter of Lucius is peculiarly
welcome, because (in its Norman-French form) it is the very
word employed by the Peterborough chronicler.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1192" id="Ref_1192" href="#Foot_1192">[1192]</a></span> As I have
pointed out in the <i>Academy</i>,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1193" id="Ref_1193" href="#Foot_1193">[1193]</a></span> the same Latin form is found in
the agenda of the judicial iter in 1194: "de prisis et <i>tenseriis</i>
omnium ballivorum" (<i>R. Hoveden</i>, iii. 267), while the Anglo-Norman
"tenserie" is employed by Jordan Fantosme, who,
writing of the burgesses of Northampton (1174), tells us that
David of Scotland "ne pot <i>tenserie</i> de eus aver." He also
illustrates the use of the verb when he describes how the Earl
of Leicester, landing in East Anglia, "la terre vait <i>tensant</i>....
E ad <i>tensé</i> la terre cum il en fut bailli." The Latin form of
the verb was "tensare," as is shown by the records of the
Lincolnshire eyre in 1202 (Maitland's <i>Select Pleas of the Crown</i>,
p. 19), where it is used of extorting toll from vessels as they
traversed the marshes. A reference to the closing portion of
the Lincolnshire survey in Domesday will show the very same
offence presented by the jurors of 1086.</p>

<p>To the same number of the <i>Academy</i>, Mr. Paget Toynbee
contributed a letter quoting some examples from Ducange of
the use of <i>tenseria</i>, one of them taken from the Council of
London in 1151: "Sancimus igitur ut Ecclesiæ et possessiones
ecclesiasticæ ab operationibus et exactionibus, quas vulgo
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">{415}</a></span>
<i>tenserias</i> sive tallagia vocant, omnino liberæ permaneant, nec
super his eas aliqui de cætero inquietare præsumant." The
other is taken from the Council of Tours<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1194" id="Ref_1194" href="#Foot_1194">[1194]</a></span> (1163), and is
specially valuable because, I think, it explains how the word
acquired its meaning. The difficulty is to deduce the sense of
"robbery" from a verb which originally meant "to protect" or
"to defend," but this difficulty is beautifully explained by our
own word "blackmail," which similarly meant money extorted
under pretence of protection or defence. The "defensio" of
the Tours Council supports this explanation, as does the curious
story told by the monks of Abingdon,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1195" id="Ref_1195" href="#Foot_1195">[1195]</a></span> that during the Anarchy
under Stephen—</p>

<p class="small">
"Willelmus Boterel constabularius de Wallingford, pecunia accepta a
domno Ingulfo abbate, res ecclesiæ Abbendonensis a suo exercitu se defensurum
promisit. Sponsionis ergo suæ immemor, in villam Culeham, quæ huic
cænobio adjacet, quicquid invenire potuit, deprædavit. Quo audito, abbas
... admirans quomodo quod tueri deberet, fure nequior diripuisset" etc.</p>

<p>William died excommunicate for this, but his brother Peter
made some slight compensation later.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1196" id="Ref_1196" href="#Foot_1196">[1196]</a></span> It was not unusual for
conscience or the Church to extort more or less restitution for
lawless conduct, as, indeed, in the case of Geoffrey de Mandeville
and his son. So, too, Earl Ferrers made a grant to Burton
Abbey "propter dampna a me et meis Ecclesiæ predictæ illata"
(cf. p. 276, <i>n.</i> 3), previous to going on pilgrimage to S. Jago de
Compostella—an early instance of a pilgrimage thither.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1197" id="Ref_1197" href="#Foot_1197">[1197]</a></span></p>

<p>While on this subject, it may be as well to add that the
grant by Robert, Earl of Leicester, to the see of Lincoln in
restitution for wrongs,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1198" id="Ref_1198" href="#Foot_1198">[1198]</a></span> may very possibly refer to his alleged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">{416}</a></span>
share in the arrest of the bishops (1139), and so confirm the
statement of Ordericus Vitalis.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1199" id="Ref_1199" href="#Foot_1199">[1199]</a></span></p>

<p>The complaint of the same English Chronicle that the lawless
barons "cruelly oppressed the wretched men of the land
with castle works" is curiously confirmed by a letter from
Pope Eugenius to four of the prelates, July 23, 1147:—</p>

<p class="small">"Religiosorum fratrum Abbendoniæ gravem querelam accepimus quod
Willelmus Martel, Hugo de Bolebec, Willelmus de Bellocampo, Johannes
Marescallus, et eorum homines, et plures etiam alii parochiani vestri, possessiones
eorum violenter invadunt, et bona ipsorum rapiunt et distrahunt et
<i>indebitas castellorum operationes ab eis exigunt</i>."<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p>With characteristic agreement upon this point, William
Martel, who served the king, John the marshal, who followed
the Empress, and William de Beauchamp, who had joined both,
were at one in the evil work.</p>

of Basset.<span class="fnanchor"><a

this one possesses special features, it is here given <i>in extenso</i>:—</p>

<p>The charter with which this one ought to be closely compared
is that granted, also at Devizes, to Humfrey de Bohun,
early in 1144.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1202" id="Ref_1202" href="#Foot_1202">[1202]</a></span> These two are the only instances I have yet
met with of <i>joint</i> charters from the Empress and her son. It
may not be unjustifiable to infer that Henry was henceforth
included as a partner in his mother's charters. If so, it would
follow that her charters in which he is not mentioned are
probably of earlier date.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1203" id="Ref_1203" href="#Foot_1203">[1203]</a></span> The second point suggested by
a comparison of these charters is that here Henry figures as
the son of the Duke of the Normans, while in the other
document he is merely son of the Count of the Angevins.
This is at once explained by the fact that her husband had now
won his promotion (1144) from Count of the Angevins to Duke
of the Normans, an explanation which confirms my remarks on
the charter to Humfrey de Bohun.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1204" id="Ref_1204" href="#Foot_1204">[1204]</a></span> Thus this charter to
Geoffrey Ridel must be later than the spring of 1144, while
anterior to Henry's departure about the end of 1146. As the
(Coucher) charter to Geoffrey de Mandeville (junior) is attested
by Humfrey as "Dapifer," that, also, may be placed subsequent
to Humfrey's own. Again, in the charter here printed, we
have proof that Richard Basset was dead at the time of its
grant, if not before. There has been hitherto no clue as to the
time of his decease, though Foss makes him die, by a strange
confusion, in 1154. Nor is it unimportant to observe that the
Bassets and Ridels were typical members of that official class
which Henry I. had fostered, and which appears to have
strongly favoured his daughter's cause. Lastly, in the re-grant
of this charter, by Duke Henry at Wallingford (1153), we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">{419}</a></span>
a valuable illustration of his practice in ignoring his mother's
charters, even when sanctioned by himself in his youth. For,
although the terms of the instrument are reproduced with
exactitude, the grant is made <i>de novo</i>, without reference to any
former charter.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<h2>EXCURSUS.</h2>

<h3>THE CREATION OF THE EARLDOM OF GLOUCESTER.</h3>

</div>

<p class="nodent"><span class="smc">One</span>
of the problems in English history as yet, it would seem,
unsolved, is that of the date at which Henry I. conferred on his
natural son Robert the earldom of Gloucester. The great part
which Robert played in the eventful struggles of his time, the
fact that this was, in all probability, almost the only earldom
created in the course of this reign (1100-1135), and the importance
of ascertaining the date of its creation as fixing that of
many an otherwise doubtful record, all combine to cause surprise
that the problem remains unsolved.</p>

<p>Brooke wrote that the earldom of Gloucester was conferred
on Robert "in the eleventh year of his father's reign," and
his critic, the argus-eyed Vincent, in his <i>Discoverie of Errours</i>,
did not question the statement. As to Dugdale, he evaded the
problem. Ignorance on the point is frankly confessed in the
<i>Reports on the Dignity of a Peer</i>; while Mr. Freeman, so far
as I can find, has also deemed discretion the better part of
valour.</p>

<p>Three dates, however, have been suggested for this creation.</p>

<p>The first is 1109. This may be traced to Sandford (1707)
and Rapin (1724), who took it from the rhyming chronicle
assigned to Robert of Gloucester:—</p>

<p class="small">"And of the kynges crownement in the [ninthe]<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1206" id="Ref_1206" href="#Foot_1206">[1206]</a></span> yere,
The vorst Erle of Gloucestre thus was mayd there."</p>

<p>This date was revived by Courthope in his well-known
edition (1857) of the <i>Historic Peerage</i> of Sir Harris Nicolas (by
whom no date had been assigned to the creation). It may be
said, by inference, to have received the sanction of the
authorities at the British Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">{421}</a></span>
The second is 1119. This suspiciously resembles an adaptation
of the preceding date, but may have been suggested, and
in the case of Mr. Clark (<i>vide infra</i>) probably was, by reading
Dugdale wrong.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1207" id="Ref_1207" href="#Foot_1207">[1207]</a></span> It seems to have first appeared in a footnote
to William of Malmesbury (1840), as edited for the
English Historical Society by the late Sir Thomas Duffus
(then Mr.) Hardy. It is there stated that Robert "was
created Earl of Gloucester in 1119" (vol. ii. p. 692). No
authority whatever is given for this statement, but the same
date is adopted by Mr. Clark (1878), who asserts that "Robert
certainly bore it [the title] 1119, 20th Henry I." (<i>Arch. Journ.</i>,
xxxv. 5); by Mr. Doyle (1886) in his valuable <i>Official Baronage</i>
(ii. 9); and lastly (1887) by Mr. Hunt in his <i>Bristol</i> (p. 17).
In none of these cases, however, is the source of the statement
given.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1208" id="Ref_1208" href="#Foot_1208">[1208]</a></span></p>

<p>In the mean while, a third date, viz. shortly before Easter
(April 2), 1116, was advanced with much assurance. In his
essay on the <i>Survey of Lindsey</i> (1882), Mr. Chester Waters
wrote:</p>

<p class="small">"We know that the earldom was conferred on him before Easter, 1116,
for he attested as earl the royal charter in favour of Tewkesbury Abbey,
which was executed at Winchester on the eve of the king's embarkation for
Normandy" (p. 3).</p>

<p>The date attributed to this charter having aroused the
curiosity of antiquaries, the somewhat singular discovery was
made that it could also be found in the MSS. of Mr. Eyton,
then lately deceased.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1209" id="Ref_1209" href="#Foot_1209">[1209]</a></span> For the time, however, Mr. Waters
enjoyed the credit of having solved an ancient problem, and
"the ennobling of Robert fitz Roy in 1116" was accepted by
no less an authority than Mr. Elton.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1210" id="Ref_1210" href="#Foot_1210">[1210]</a></span></p>

<p>I propose to show that these three dates are all alike
erroneous, and that the Tewkesbury charter is spurious.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">{422}</a></span>
Let us first observe that there is no evidence for the belief
that Robert received his earldom at the time of his marriage to
the heiress of Robert fitz Hamon. There is, on the contrary, a
probability that he did not. I do not insist on the Tewkesbury
charter (<i>Mon. Ang.</i>, ii. 66), in which the king speaks of the
demesne of Robert fitz Hamon as being now "Dominium
Roberti filii mei," for we have more direct evidence in a
charter of Robert to the church of Rochester, in which he confirmed
the gifts made by his wife and father, not as Robert
Earl of Gloucester, but merely as "Ego Rodbertus Henrici
Regis filius."</p>

<p>We must further dismiss late authorities, in which, as we
might expect, we find a tendency to throw back the creation of
a title to an early period of the grantee's life. We cannot
accept as valid evidence the rhymes of Robert of Gloucester
(<i>circa</i> 1300), the confusion of later writers, or the assumptions
of the fourteenth-century <i>Chronicque de Normandie</i>, in which last
work Robert is represented as already "Earl of Gloucester" at
the battle of Tinchebrai (1106).</p>

<p>The only chronicle that we can safely consult is that of the
Continuator of William of Jumièges, and this, unfortunately,
tells us nothing as to the date of the creation, which, however,
it seems to place some time after the marriage. It is worth
mentioning that the writer's words—</p>

<p class="small">"Præterea, quia parum erat filium Regis ingentia prædia possidere absque
nomine et honore alicujus publicæ dignitatis, dedit illi pater pius comitatum
Gloecestre" (Lib. viii. cap. 29, ed. Duchesne, p. 306).</p>

<p>are suspiciously suggestive of Robert of Gloucester's famous
story that Robert's bride refused to marry him "bote he adde
an tuo name." It would be very satisfactory if we could thus
trace the story to its source, the more so as the chronicle is not
among those from which Robert is supposed to have drawn.</p>

<p>We are, therefore, left dependent on the evidence of charters
alone. That is to say, we must look to the styles given to
Robert the king's son, to learn when he first became Earl of
Gloucester.</p>

<p>His earliest attestation is, to all appearance, that which
occurs in a charter of 1113. This charter is printed in the
appendix to the edition of Ordericus Vitalis by the Société de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">{423}</a></span>
l'Histoire de France,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1211" id="Ref_1211" href="#Foot_1211">[1211]</a></span> and as all the circumstances connected
with its grant, together with the names of the chief witnesses,
are given by Ordericus in the body of his work,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1212" id="Ref_1212" href="#Foot_1212">[1212]</a></span> there cannot
be the slightest doubt, or even hesitation, as to its date.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1213" id="Ref_1213" href="#Foot_1213">[1213]</a></span> In
the text he is styled "Rodbertus regis filius," and in the
charter "Rodbertus filius regis," his name being given, it
should be noticed, last but one. The next attestation, in order,
it would seem, is found in a writ of Henry I. tested at Reading,
some time before Easter, 1116, to judge from the presence of
"Rannulfus Meschinus."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1214" id="Ref_1214" href="#Foot_1214">[1214]</a></span> For Randulf became Earl of Chester
by the death of his cousin Richard, when returning to England
with the king in November, 1120.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1215" id="Ref_1215" href="#Foot_1215">[1215]</a></span></p>

<p>We next find Robert in Normandy with his father. He
there attests a charter to Savigny, his name ("Robertus filius
regis") coming immediately after those of the earls (in this
case Stephen, Count of Mortain, and Richard, Earl of Chester),
that being the position in which, till his creation, it henceforth
always figures. This charter passed in 1118, probably in the
autumn of the year.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1216" id="Ref_1216" href="#Foot_1216">[1216]</a></span> Robert's next appearance is at the battle
of Brémulé (or Noyon), August 20, 1119. Ordericus refers to
his presence thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Ibi fuerunt duo filii ejus Rodbertus et Ricardus, milites egregii, et tres
consules," etc., etc. (iv. 357).</p>

<p>This is certainly opposed to the view that Robert was already
an earl, for he is carefully distinguished from the three earls
("tres consules") who were present, and is classed with his
brother Richard, who never became an earl. We must assign
to about the same date the confirmation charter of Colchester
Abbey, which is known to us only from the unpublished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">{424}</a></span>
cartulary now in the possession of Lord Cowper. Robert's
name here comes immediately after those of the earls, and his
style is "Robertus filius henrici regis Anglorum."</p>

<p>This charter suggests a very important question. That its
form, in the cartulary, is that in which it was originally
granted we may confidently deny. At the same time, the
circumstances by which its grant was accompanied are told
by the monks in great detail and in the form of a separate
narrative. Indeed, on that narrative is based the belief, so
dear to Mr. Freeman's heart, that Henry I. was, more or
less, familiar with the English tongue. Moreover, it is suggested
by internal evidence that the charter, as we have it,
is based on an originally genuine record. Now, the accepted
practice is to class charters as genuine, doubtful, or spurious,
"doubtful" meaning only that they are either genuine or
spurious, but that it is not quite certain to which of these
classes they belong. For my part I see no reason why there
should not be an indefinite number of stages between an
absolutely genuine record and one that is a sheer forgery. It
was often, whether truly or falsely, alleged (we may have our
own suspicions) that the charter originally granted had been
lost, stolen, or burnt. In the case of this particular charter,
its predecessor was said to have been lost; at Leicester, a riot
was made accountable; at Carlisle a fire. In these last two
cases, those who were affected were allowed to depose to the
tenor of the lost charter. In the case of that which we are now
considering, I have recorded in another place<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1217" id="Ref_1217" href="#Foot_1217">[1217]</a></span> my belief that
the story was probably a plot of the monks anxious to secure
an enlarged charter. Of course, where a charter was really
lost, and it was thought necessary to supply its place either by
a pseudo-original document, or merely in a cartulary, deliberate
invention was the only resource. But, in such cases, it was
almost certain that, in the days when the means of historical
information were, compared with our own, non-existent, the
forger would betray himself at once by the names in his list of
witnesses. There was, however, as I imagine, another class
of forged charters. This comprised those cases in which the
original had not been lost, but in which it was desired to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">{425}</a></span>
substitute for that original a charter with more extensive
grants. Here the genuine list of witnesses might, of course, be
copied, and with a little skill the interpolations or alterations
might be so made as to render detection difficult, if not
impossible. I speak, of course, of a cartulary transcript; in
an actual charter, the document and seal would greatly assist
detection. But I would suggest that there might be another
class to be considered. This Colchester charter is a case in
point. The impression it conveys to my mind is that of a
genuine charter, adapted by a systematic process of florid and
grandiloquent adornment to a depraved monkish taste. In
short, I look on this charter as not, of necessity, a "forgery,"
that is, intended to deceive, but as possibly representing the
results of a process resembling that of illumination. Such
an hypothesis may appear daring, but it is based, we must
remember, on a mental attitude, on, so to speak, an historic
conscience, radically different from our own. After all, it is
but in the present generation that the sacredness of an original
record has been recognized as it should. Such a conception
was wholly foreign to the men of the Middle Ages. I had
occasion to allude to this essential fact in a study on "The
Book of Howth," when calling attention to the strange liberties
allowed themselves by the early translators of the <i>Expugnatio
Hiberniæ</i>. Geoffrey of Monmouth illustrates the point. Looking
not only at him but his contemporaries in the twelfth
century, we cannot but compare the impertinent obtrusion of
their pseudo-classical and, still more, their incorrigible Biblical
erudition, with the same peculiar features in such charters as
those of which I speak. Another remarkable parallel, I think,
may be found in the <i>Dialogus de Scaccario</i>. Observe there the
opening passage, together with the persistent obtrusion of texts,
and compare them with the general type of forged, spurious, or
"doctored" charters. The resemblance is very striking. It
was, one might say, the systematic practice of the monkish
forger or adapter to make the royal or other grantor in such
charters as these indulge in a homily from the monkish standpoint
on the obligation to make such grants, and to quote texts
in support of that thesis. Once viewed in this light, such
passages are as intelligible as they are absurd.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">{426}</a></span></p>

<p>But, in addition to, and distinct from, these stilted moralizations,
is the process which I have ventured to compare with
illumination or even embroidery. This was, in most cases, so
overdone, as to bury the simple phraseology of the original, if
genuine, instrument beneath a pile of grandiloquence. Take
for instance this clause from the Colchester charter in question:</p>

<p class="small">"Data Rothomagi deo gratias solemniter et feliciter Anno ab incarn'
dom' <small>MCXIX</small>. Quo nimirum anno prætaxatus filius regis Henrici Will's rex
designatus puellam nobilissimam filiam Fulconis Andegavorum comitis
Mathildam nomine Luxouii duxit uxorem."</p>

<p>Now, if we compare this clause with that appended to an
original charter of some ten years later, we there read thus:—</p>

<p class="small">"Apud Wintoniam eodem anno, inter Pascham et Pentecostem, quo Rex
duxit in uxorem filiam ducis de Luvain."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1218" id="Ref_1218" href="#Foot_1218">[1218]</a></span></p>

<p>This peculiar method of dating charters which is found in
this reign suggests that the genuine charter to Colchester
would contain a similar clause (if any),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1219" id="Ref_1219" href="#Foot_1219">[1219]</a></span> beginning "Apud
Rothomagum eodem anno quo," etc., etc. As it stands in the
cartulary, the original clause has been treated by the monkish
scribe much as an original passage in a chronicle might be
worked into his text, in the present day, by an historian of the
"popular" school.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1220" id="Ref_1220" href="#Foot_1220">[1220]</a></span> But wide and interesting though the conclusions
are to which such an hypothesis might lead, I must
confine myself here to pointing out that the list of witnesses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">{427}</a></span>
in its minutest details, is apparently beyond impeachment.
Specially would I refer to four names, those of the clerks of
the king's chapel. It is rare, indeed, to find so complete and
careful a list. The four "capellani regis," as they are here
styled, are (1) John de Bayeux;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1221" id="Ref_1221" href="#Foot_1221">[1221]</a></span> (2) Nigel de Caine;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1222" id="Ref_1222" href="#Foot_1222">[1222]</a></span> (3)
Robert "Pechet;"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1223" id="Ref_1223" href="#Foot_1223">[1223]</a></span> (4) Richard "custos sigilli regis."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1224" id="Ref_1224" href="#Foot_1224">[1224]</a></span> The
remarkable and, we may fairly assume, undesigned coincidence
between the list of witnesses attesting this charter, and that of
the king's followers at the battle of Brémulé (fought, there is
reason to believe, within a few weeks of its grant), as given
by Ordericus Vitalis, ought to be carefully noted, confirming,
as it obviously does, the authority of both the lists, and consequently
my hypothesis that the charter in the Colchester
cartulary represents a genuine original record belonging to the
date alleged.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1225" id="Ref_1225" href="#Foot_1225">[1225]</a></span></p>

<p>It is also, perhaps, worth notice that Eadmer applies to
William "the Ætheling" the very same term as that which
meets us in this charter, namely, "designatus."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1226" id="Ref_1226" href="#Foot_1226">[1226]</a></span></p>

<p>Approaching now the question of date, we note that the
charter must have been subsequent to the marriage at Lisieux
(June, 1119) to which it refers, and previous to the Council
of Rheims (October 20, 1119), which Archbishop Thurstan
attended, and from which he did not return.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1227" id="Ref_1227" href="#Foot_1227">[1227]</a></span> We know that
between these dates Henry was in Rouen at least once, viz. at
the end of September (1119),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1228" id="Ref_1228" href="#Foot_1228">[1228]</a></span> so that we can determine the
date of the charter within exceedingly narrow limits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">{428}</a></span></p>

<p>The remaining charters which we have now to examine are
all subsequent to the king's return and the disaster of the
White Ship (November 25, 1120).</p>

<p>The desolate king had spent his Christmas (1120) in comparative
seclusion at Brampton, attended by his nephew,
Theobald of Blois.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1229" id="Ref_1229" href="#Foot_1229">[1229]</a></span> In January (1121) he came south to attend
a great council before his approaching marriage. By Eadmer
and the Continuator of Florence of Worcester, the assembling
of the council is assigned to the Epiphany (January 6, 1121).
Richard "de Sigillo" was on the following day (January 7)
elected to the see of Hereford, and was consecrated nine days
later (January 16, 1121) at Lambeth.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1230" id="Ref_1230" href="#Foot_1230">[1230]</a></span></p>

<p>To this council we may safely assign a charter in the British
Museum (Harley, 111, B. 46),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1231" id="Ref_1231" href="#Foot_1231">[1231]</a></span> of value for its list of witnesses,
twenty-six in number. It gives us the names of no fewer than
thirteen bishops, by whom, in addition to the primate, this
council was attended.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1232" id="Ref_1232" href="#Foot_1232">[1232]</a></span> Mr. Walter de Gray Birch, by whom
so much has been done to encourage the study of charters and
of seals, has edited this record in one of his instructive sphragistic
monographs.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1233" id="Ref_1233" href="#Foot_1233">[1233]</a></span> He has, however, by an unfortunate inadvertence,
omitted about half a dozen witnesses,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1234" id="Ref_1234" href="#Foot_1234">[1234]</a></span> while his two
limits of date are not quite correct; for Richard was consecrated
Bishop of Hereford, not on "the 16th of January, 1120,"
but on the 16th of January, 1121 (N.S.), and Archbishop Ralph
died, not "19th September," but 19th October (xiv. kal.
Novembris), 1122. Thus the limit for this charter would be,
not "from April, 1120, to September, 1122," but from January,
1121, to October, 1122. Mr. Birch further observes that "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">{429}</a></span>
date may be taken very shortly after the consecration of
Richard." Here again, I must reluctantly differ, for by the
practice of the time, the grant of the temporalities did not come
after, but before, the consecration. The charter, in short, as
I observed above, can be safely assigned to the council of
January, 1121.</p>

<p>In it the subject of this paper attests as "Roberto filio
Regis." His name occurs in its right place immediately after
those of the earls, who, oddly enough, are in this charter the
same two, at least in title,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1235" id="Ref_1235" href="#Foot_1235">[1235]</a></span> after whom he had attested the
Savigny charter in 1118.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1236" id="Ref_1236" href="#Foot_1236">[1236]</a></span></p>

<p>The next charters in my chain of evidence are two which
passed at Windsor. We are told by Simeon of Durham that at
the time of the king's marriage (January 29-30, 1121) there
was gathered together at Windsor a council of the whole realm.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1237" id="Ref_1237" href="#Foot_1237">[1237]</a></span>
To this council I assign a charter printed by Madox from the
original among the archives of Westminster Abbey.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1238" id="Ref_1238" href="#Foot_1238">[1238]</a></span> I am led
to do so because, firstly, the names of the witnesses are all
found, with three exceptions, in charters belonging to this date;
second, the said three exceptions are those of Count Theobald
of Blois, who had, we know, joined the king not long before, of
Earl David, from Scotland, whose visit would be due to the occasion
of his brother-in-law's wedding, and of the Archbishop of
Rouen, whose presence may be also thus accounted for;<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1239" id="Ref_1239" href="#Foot_1239">[1239]</a></span> third,
the attestation of two archbishops with four bishops suggests the
presence of a "concilium," as described by Simeon of Durham.</p>

<p>If this is the date of the charter in question, it may also be
that of another charter, also to Westminster Abbey,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1240" id="Ref_1240" href="#Foot_1240">[1240]</a></span> for its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">{430}</a></span>
eleven witnesses are all found among those of the preceding
charter. In both these cases "Robert, the king's son," attests
in his regular place immediately after the earls.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1241" id="Ref_1241" href="#Foot_1241">[1241]</a></span></p>

<p>We now come to an original charter in every way of the
highest importance.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1242" id="Ref_1242" href="#Foot_1242">[1242]</a></span> I have already quoted its dating clause,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1243" id="Ref_1243" href="#Foot_1243">[1243]</a></span>
which proves it to have been executed at Winchester, between
Easter (April 10) and Pentecost (May 29), 1121. Moreover, as
the king spent his Easter at Berkeley and his Whitsuntide at
Westminster,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1244" id="Ref_1244" href="#Foot_1244">[1244]</a></span> the limit of date, as a matter of fact, is somewhat
narrower still. Here again Robert attests ("Rob[erto]
fil[io] Regis") at the head of all the laity beneath the rank
of earl.</p>

<p>The last charter which I propose to adduce, as attested by
"Robert, the king's son," is one which, in all probability, may
be assigned to this same occasion, for the whole of its thirteen
witnesses had attested the previous charter, with the exception
of two bishops, whose presence can be otherwise accounted for,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1245" id="Ref_1245" href="#Foot_1245">[1245]</a></span>
and of William de Warenne (Earl of Surrey).</p>

<p>The importance of this charter is not so great as that of
those adduced above, for it is known to us only from the Rymer
Collectanea (<i>Add. MSS.</i>, 4573), of which an abstract is appended
to the Fœdera.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1246" id="Ref_1246" href="#Foot_1246">[1246]</a></span> Moreover, in one minute detail its accuracy
may be fairly impugned, for "Willielmo de Warennâ" clearly
stands for "Willielmo <i>Comite</i> de Warennâ," Nor, indeed, is its
evidence needed, the proof being complete without it. Yet, as
the charter (<i>quantum valeat</i>) has been assigned, I think, to a
wrong date, the point may be worth glancing at. In the Rymer
Collectanea the date is fixed as "1115" (or "16 Henry I.") on the
ground that it belongs to the same date as a charter of Henry I.
to Bardney, which was granted "Apud Wynton' xvj. anno
postquam rex recepit regnum Angliæ."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1247" id="Ref_1247" href="#Foot_1247">[1247]</a></span> Mr. Eyton also, in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">{431}</a></span>
late addition to his MS. Itinerary of Henry I.,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1248" id="Ref_1248" href="#Foot_1248">[1248]</a></span> wrote that the
presence of three of the bishops (Lincoln, Salisbury, and St
David's) suggested "the latter part of 1115." But we must
remember that the Bardney charter is known to us only from a
late Inspeximus,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1249" id="Ref_1249" href="#Foot_1249">[1249]</a></span> and that the dating clause is somewhat suspicious.
Yet even if the version were entirely genuine, the
fact remains that the list of witnesses has only four names<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1250" id="Ref_1250" href="#Foot_1250">[1250]</a></span> in
common with that in the charter I am discussing, which has,
on the contrary, no less than ten in common with those in the
original charter of 1121.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1251" id="Ref_1251" href="#Foot_1251">[1251]</a></span> I cannot, therefore, but fix on 1121
as a far more probable date for its grant than 1115-1116.</p>

<p>This, however, as I said, is but a small matter. The really
important fact is this: that we have a continuous chain of
evidence, proving that "Robert, the king's son," was not yet
Earl of Gloucester, at least as late as April-May, 1121.</p>

<p>Against this weight of accumulated evidence what is there?
Absolutely nothing but that Tewkesbury charter, which is
quoted from Dugdale's <i>Monasticon</i>, where it is quoted from a
mere <i>Inspeximus</i> of the 10th Henry IV. (1408-9), some three
centuries after its alleged date!<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1252" id="Ref_1252" href="#Foot_1252">[1252]</a></span> I need scarcely say that this
miserable evidence for the assertion that Robert was Earl of
Gloucester, at Easter, 1116, is simply annihilated and crumpled
up by the proof afforded by original charters that he had not
yet received the earldom even five years later on (1121).</p>

<p>It is, however, satisfactory to be able to add that, even
independent of this rebutting evidence, the charter itself, on its
own face, bears witness of its spurious character. Mr. Eyton,
indeed, was slightly uneasy about two of the witnesses, it being,
he thought, as unusually early for an attestation of Brian fitz
Count, as it was late for that of Hamo Dapifer.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1253" id="Ref_1253" href="#Foot_1253">[1253]</a></span> Yet he was
not, on that account, led to reject it; indeed, he not only
accepted, but unfortunately built upon its evidence. He never,
however, we must remember, committed his conclusions to print,
so that it may be urged with perfect justice that he might
have reconsidered and changed his views before he made them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">{432}</a></span>
public. Not so with Mr. Chester Waters. Announcing the discovery
which Mr. Eyton had so strangely anticipated, he wrote—</p>

<p class="small">"We know that the earldom [of Gloucester] was conferred on him
[Robert] before Easter, 1116, for he attested as earl the royal charter in
favour of Tewkesbury Abbey which was executed at Winchester, on the eve
of the king's embarkation for Normandy (<i>Monasticon</i>, vol. ii. p. 66)."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1254" id="Ref_1254" href="#Foot_1254">[1254]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mr. Waters thus wrote, had he observed that in this
charter the king's style appears as "Henr' dei gratia Rex Angl'
<i>et dux Norm'</i>"? And if he had done so, if he had glanced
at the charter on which he based his case, is it possible that
he was so unfamiliar with the charters and the writs of
Henry I., as not to be aware that such a style, of itself, throws
doubt upon the charter?<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1255" id="Ref_1255" href="#Foot_1255">[1255]</a></span> To those who remember that he
confessed (in reply to certain criticisms of my own) to having
"carelessly repeated a statement which comes from a discredited
authority,"<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1256" id="Ref_1256" href="#Foot_1256">[1256]</a></span> and that he announced a discovery as to
the meeting of Henry I. and Robert of Normandy, in 1101,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1257" id="Ref_1257" href="#Foot_1257">[1257]</a></span>
which, as I proved, was based only on his own failure to read
a charter of this reign aright,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1258" id="Ref_1258" href="#Foot_1258">[1258]</a></span> such a correction as this will
come as no surprise.</p>

<p>Having now shown that Robert fitz Roy was not yet Earl
of Gloucester in April-May, 1121, I proceed to show that he
was earl in June, 1123.</p>

<p>The charter by which I prove this is granted "apud Portesmudam
in transfretatione meâ."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1259" id="Ref_1259" href="#Foot_1259">[1259]</a></span> It is dated in the thirty-first
Report of the Deputy Keeper of the Records (in the calendar
of these charters drawn up by the late Sir William Hardy)
as "1115-1123." Its exact date can, however, be determined,
and is 3-10 June, 1123. This I prove thus. The parties
addressed are Theowulf, Bishop of Worcester (who died
October 20, 1123), and Robert, Earl of Gloucester (who was
not yet earl in April-May, 1121). These being the limits of
date, the only occasion within these limits on which the king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">{433}</a></span>
"transfretavit" was in June, 1123. And we learn from the
Anglo-Saxon Chronicle that the king, on that occasion, was at
Portsmouth, waiting to cross, all Pentecost week (June 3-10).
This is conclusive.</p>

<p>It is certain, therefore, that Robert fitz Roy received the
earldom of Gloucester between April-May, 1121, and June,
1123. We may even reduce this limit if we can trust a charter
in the Register of St. Osmund (i. 382) which is absurdly
assigned in the Rolls edition to circ. 1109. The occurrence
of Robert, Earl of Leicester, proves that it must be subsequent
to his father's death in 1118, and consequently (as the charter
is tested at Westminster) to the king's return in 1120. Again,
as Bishop Robert of Lincoln witnesses the charter, it must be
previous to his death, January 10, 1123, But as the king had
not been at Westminster for some time before that, it cannot
be placed later than 1122. Now, we have seen that in April-May,
1121, Robert was not yet Earl of Gloucester; consequently,
this charter must belong to the period between that date and
the close of 1122. It is, therefore, the earliest mention, as yet
known to me, of Robert as Earl of Gloucester. As we increase
our knowledge of the charters of this reign we shall doubtless
be able to narrow further the limit I have thus ascertained.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a charter which, if we could trust it,
would greatly reduce the limit. This is Henry I.'s great charter
to Merton,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1260" id="Ref_1260" href="#Foot_1260">[1260]</a></span> which is attested by Robert, as Earl of Gloucester,
and which purports to have passed August 5-December 31,
1121 (? 24th March, 1122).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1261" id="Ref_1261" href="#Foot_1261">[1261]</a></span> But it is quite certain that, in the
form we have it, this charter is spurious. It is true that the
names given in the long list of witnesses are, apparently, consistent
with the date,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1262" id="Ref_1262" href="#Foot_1262">[1262]</a></span> but all else is fatally bad. Both the charter
itself, and the attestations thereto, are in the worst and most
turgid style; the precedence of the witnesses is distinctly
wrong,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1263" id="Ref_1263" href="#Foot_1263">[1263]</a></span> and the mention of the year-date would alone rouse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">{434}</a></span>
suspicion. Whether, and, if so, to what extent, the charter
is based on a genuine document, it is not easy to decide.
A reference to the new <i>Monasticon</i> will show that there is a
difficulty, a conflict of testimony, about the facts of the foundation.
This increases the doubt as to the authenticity of the
charter, from the evidence of which, if not confirmed, we are
certainly not entitled to draw any authoritative conclusion as
to the date of Robert's creation.</p>

<p>Adhering then, for the present, to the limits I have given
above (1121-1122) I may point out that Robert's promotion
may possibly have been due to his increased importance, consequent
on the loss in the White Ship of the king's only
legitimate son, and of his natural son Richard. Of Henry's
three adult sons he now alone remained.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1264" id="Ref_1264" href="#Foot_1264">[1264]</a></span> It is certain that
he henceforth continued to improve his position and power
till, as we know, he contested with his future rival, Stephen,
the honour of being first among the magnates to swear
allegiance to the Empress.</p>

<p>Before passing to a corollary of the conclusion arrived at in
this paper it may be well to glance at Robert's younger brother
and namesake. This was a son of Henry by another mother,
Edith, whose parentage, by the way, suggests a genealogical
problem.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1265" id="Ref_1265" href="#Foot_1265">[1265]</a></span> He was quite a nonentity in the history of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">{435}</a></span>
time as compared with the elder Robert; nor does his name,
so far as I know, occur before 1130, when it is entered in the
Pipe-Roll for that year. He is found as a witness to one of
his royal father's charters, which is only known to us from
the <i>Cartæ Antiquæ</i>, and which belongs to the end of the reign.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1266" id="Ref_1266" href="#Foot_1266">[1266]</a></span>
There is no possibility of confusion between his brother and
himself, for his earliest attestations are, as we have seen,
several years later than his brother's elevation to the earldom,
so that they cannot both have been attesting, at any one period,
as "Robert, the king's son." It is, moreover, self-evident that
such a style could only be used when there was but one person
whom it could be held to denote.</p>

<p>As illustrating the value of such researches as these, and
the importance of securing a "fixed point" as a help for other
inquiries, I shall now give an instance of the results consequent
on ascertaining the date of this creation. Let us turn to that
remarkable record among the muniments of St. Paul's, which
the present Deputy Keeper of the Records first made public,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1267" id="Ref_1267" href="#Foot_1267">[1267]</a></span>
and which has since been published <i>in extenso</i> and in fac-simile
by the Corporation of London in their valuable <i>History of the
Guildhall</i>. The importance of this record lies in its mention
of the wards of the City, with their respective rulers, at an
exceptionally early date. What that date was it is most
desirable to learn. Mr. Loftie has rightly, in his later work,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1268" id="Ref_1268" href="#Foot_1268">[1268]</a></span>
made the greatest use of this list, which he describes (p. 93)
as "the document I have so often quoted as containing a list
of the lands of the dean and chapter before 1115." Indeed,
he invariably treats this document as one "which must have
been written before 1115" (p. 82). But the only reason to be
found for his conclusion is that—</p>

<p class="small">"Coleman Street appears in the St. Paul's list as 'Warda Reimundi,'
and this is the more interesting as we know that Reimund, or Reinmund,
was dead before 1115, which helps us to date the document. Azo, his son,
succeeded him" (p. 89).<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1269" id="Ref_1269" href="#Foot_1269">[1269]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">{436}</a></span>
This is a most astounding statement, considering that all "we
know," from these documents, of Reimund or Reinmund is
that both he and his son Azo were living in 1132, when they
attested a charter!<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1270" id="Ref_1270" href="#Foot_1270">[1270]</a></span> Turning from this strange blunder to
the fact that the Earl of Gloucester is among those mentioned
in this list,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1271" id="Ref_1271" href="#Foot_1271">[1271]</a></span> we learn at once that, so far from being <i>earlier</i> than
1115, it is <i>later</i> than the earl's creation in 1121-1122. And
this conclusion accords well with the fact that other names
which it contains, such as those of John fitz Ralf (fitz
Evrard),<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1272" id="Ref_1272" href="#Foot_1272">[1272]</a></span> William Malet, etc., belong to the close of the
reign.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1273" id="Ref_1273" href="#Foot_1273">[1273]</a></span></p>

<p>Before taking leave of this record, I would glance at the
curious entry:—</p>

<p class="small">"Terra Gialle [reddit] ii sol[idos] et est latitudinis <small>LII</small> pedum longitudinis
<small>CXXXII</small> pedum."</p>

<p>Mr. Price, the editor of the work, renders this "The land
of Gialla;" but what possible proper name can "Gialla"
represent? When we find that the list is followed by a
reference to the Jews being "incarcerati apud Gyhalam," <i>temp.</i>
Edward I., and when Mr. Price admits that "Gyaula" is
among the early forms of "Guildhall," is it too rash a conjecture
that we have in the above "Gialla" a mention of the
Guildhall of London earlier, by far, than he, or any one else,
has ever yet discovered?</p>

1113), and when it had been drawn up, it received his formal approval at

of this record with the names given by Ordericus Vitalis (iv. 329) of
those present at the Council of Rouen, October 7, 1118, makes it all but certain
that it passed on that occasion.</p>

This is specially applicable to the insertion of the year in numerals.
Such date would be, though actually an addition, yet a legitimate inference
from the event alluded to in the charter. It may be worth alluding to
another case, though it stands on somewhat a different footing, to illustrate
the infinite variety of treatment to which such charters were subjected, even
when there were neither occasion nor intention to deceive. This is that of
the final agreement between the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, of
which the record is preserved at Canterbury. It has been discovered that
the document from which historians have quoted (A. 1) is not really the
original, but a copy "which was plainly intended for public exhibition"
(<i>Fifth Report Hist. MSS.</i>, App. i. p. 452). Moreover, the real original (A. 2)
was found not to contain the final clause (narrating the place and circumstances
of the agreement), which is hence supposed to have been subsequently
added, for the sake of convenience, by the clerk. (See my letter in
<i>Athenæum</i>, December 19, 1891.)</p>

If, as suggested by the narrative in the <i>Monasticon</i> of the foundation
of Osney Abbey, her father's name was "Forne," one is tempted to ask if
the bearer of so uncommon a name was identical with the Forn Ligulfson
("Forne filius Ligulfi"), who is mentioned by Simeon of Durham, in 1121,
as one of the magnates of Northumbria, and if so, whether the latter was son
of the wealthy but ill-fated Ligulf, murdered near Durham in 1080. Should
both these queries be answered in the affirmative, Edith would have been
named after her grandmother "Eadgyth," the highly born wife of Ligulf.
Writing at a distance from works of reference I cannot tell whether such a
descent has been suggested before, but it would certainly, could it be proved,
be of quite exceptional interest. Edith, as is tolerably well known, was first
the mistress of Henry, and then the wife of Robert D'Oilli. Thus her son
by the former, Robert fitz Edith (see p. 94, <i>n.</i> 4), was (half)-brother to Henry
D'Oilli, and is so described by the latter in one of his grants to Osney (Dugdale's
<i>Baronage</i>, i. 460). It should be added that an "Ivo fil' Forn" appears
in the Pipe-Roll of 1130 (p. 25). Was he brother to Edith?</p>

Mr. Loftie elsewhere tells us (p. 27) that Reinmund "was succeeded

to identify with one of the Azors of Domesday." How does Mr. Loftie
know that Azo was "more eminent" than his father, or that he was a
"goldsmith"? On one point we can certainly agree with him. It <i>would</i>
be most "interesting" to identify a Domesday tenant in a man whose father

<p>Page <a href="#Page_5">5</a>. The assertion by the Continuator of Florence of
Worcester that Stephen kept his coronation court "cum totius
Angliæ primoribus" has an important bearing on the assertion
by Florence that Harold was elected to the throne "a totius
Angliæ primatibus." For this latter phrase is the sheet-anchor
upon which Mr. Freeman relies for the fact of Harold's valid
election, and which he is avowedly compelled to strain to the
uttermost:—</p>

<p class="small">"He was chosen, not by some small or packed assembly, but by the chief
men of the land. And he was chosen, not by this or that shire or earldom,
but by the chief men of the whole land.... All this is implied in the
weighty and carefully chosen words of Florence" (<i>Norman Conquest</i> (1869),
iii. 597).</p>

<p class="nodent">So also he confidently insists that—</p>

<p class="small">"There can be no doubt that the Witan of Northumberland, no less than
the Witan of the rest of England, had concurred in the election of Harold.
The expressions of our best authorities declare that the chief men of all
England concurred in the choice" (<i>ibid.</i>, p. 57).</p>

<p>The only authority given for this assertion is the above
statement by Florence that "Harold was 'a totius Angliæ primatibus
ad regale culmen electus.'"</p>

<p>Now, the known authorities from which Florence worked
(the Abingdon and Worcester chronicles) "are," Mr. Freeman
admits, "silent about the election." The fact, therefore, rests
on the <i>ipse dixit</i> of Florence (for the words of the Peterborough
chronicler are quite general, and, moreover, he is admittedly
a partisan), who was, strictly speaking, not a contemporary
authority.</p>

<p>Stephen's election, as Mr. Freeman observes, "can hardly
fail to call to our minds" that of Harold, and in the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">{438}</a></span>
Stephen's accession we have what he himself terms the "valuable
contemporary" evidence of the Continuator of Florence."
This evidence, which is better, because more contemporary,
than that of Florence as to 1066, is equally precise (<i>vide supra</i>),
and might, in the absence of rebutting testimony, be appealed
to as confidently as Mr. Freeman appeals to that of Florence.
But in this case it is proved, by rebutting evidence, to be worthless,
just as it is at Maud's "reception" in 1141 (see p. 64).</p>

<p>Therefore, we see how dangerous it is to accept such statements,
when unsupported, as exact in every detail, and are led
to regard the words of Florence as a mere conventional phrase,
rather than to hold, as Mr. Freeman insists, that in "no passage
in any writer of any age ... does every word deserve to be
more attentively weighed."</p>

<p>The caution with which such evidence should be used is one
of the chief lessons this work is intended to enforce (see p. 267).</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_8">8</a>. There is much confusion as to the charters of liberties
issued by Stephen. The "second" charter, as explained
in the text, was issued at Oxford in the spring of 1136; the
other, commonly termed the "coronation" charter, is found
only, it would seem, in the Cottonian MS. Claud. D. II., and
has no note of date. Mr. Hubert Hall has been good enough
to inform me that the authority of this MS. is first-rate; and,
as to the date at which the charter was issued, that of the
coronation, there is no doubt, was the most <i>probable</i>. It is
important to observe that the oath stated by William of Malmesbury
to have been taken by Stephen at his first arrival (and
afterwards committed to writing at Oxford) was "de libertate
reddenda ecclesiæ et conservanda." William's remark that
this oath, "postea scripto inditum, loco suo non prætermittam,"
proves that he must have looked on the <i>Oxford</i> charter as the
record of this oath in writing; for that is the only charter
which he gives in his work. This fits in with the fact that the
charter assigned to the coronation contains no mention of the
Church and her liberties, while the "second" (Oxford) charter
is full of them. It would appear, then, that the Oxford charter
combined the original oath to the Church with the "coronation"
charter to the people at large, at the same time expanding
them both in fuller detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">{439}</a></span>
Page <a href="#Page_37">37</a>. (Cf. p. <a href="#Page_354">354</a>.) It would, perhaps, have been rash
to introduce into the text the conjecture that in the first Geoffrey
de Mandeville we have the actual "Gosfregth Portirefan"
to whom the Conqueror's charter to the citizens of London
was addressed, although the story in the <i>De Inventione</i>, the
known connection of the Mandevilles with the shrievalty, and
the striking resemblance of the two names (even closer than in
"Esegar" and "Ansgar"), all point to the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The association of the custody of the Tower with the
shrievalty of London and Middlesex is a point of considerable
interest, because in other cases—such as those of Worcestershire,
Gloucestershire, Wilts, and Devon—we find the custody
of the fortress in the county town and the shrievalty of the
shire hereditarily vested in the same hands.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_74">74</a>. The phrase "in regni dominam electa" must, as
explained in the text, not be pressed too far, as it may be
loosely used. But the parallel is too curious to be passed over.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_92">92</a>. The grant of "excidamenta" confers on Geoffrey
the escheatorship of Essex to the exclusion of any Crown
officer.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_93">93</a>. The closing clauses of this charter suggest that
Geoffrey was even then guarding himself against the consequences
of future treason.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_103">103</a>. The grants of knight-service to Geoffrey should
be carefully compared with those, by Henry I., to William de
Albini "Pincerna," as recorded in the <i>carta</i> of his fief (<i>Liber
Rubeus</i>, ed. Hall, p. 397), and are also illustrated by the charter
to Aubrey, p. 189.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_112">112</a>. "Archiepiscopo Cant." is, of course, a transcriber's
wrong extension for "Arch[idiacono] Cant."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_116">116</a>. The phrase "senatoribus inclitis, civibus honoratis,
et omnibus commune London" may be compared with the
"cent partz et a laut poble et comunautat de Baione" on
p. 248.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_182">182</a>. The expression "una baronia" should be noted
as a very early instance of its use.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_189">189</a>. The name of Abbot Ording dates this charter as
between 1148 and 1156 (<i>Memorials of St. Edmundsbury</i>, I.
xxxiv.).</p>

see the Camden Society's edition of Jocelyn de Brakelonde.</p>

<p>"Alanus filius Frodonis" was probably the heir of Frodo,
brother to Abbot Baldwin of St. Edmund's (see Domesday).</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_205">205</a>. Compare William of Malmesbury's criticism on
Stephen's conduct in attacking Lincoln (1140) without due
notice: "Iniquum id visum multis," etc.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_235">235</a>. The transcriber is responsible, of course, for the
extension of the king's style.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_242">242</a>. It is only fair to add that the peculiar strength
of the words of inheritance might be held to support the view
that hereditary earldoms were a novelty.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_267">267</a>. The charters of Henry II. to certain earls in no
way affect my real contention, namely, that no "fiscal" earls
were, as is alleged, deprived by him of their earldoms.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_275">275</a>. On the gradual resumption of Crown Lands, see
my <i>Ancient Charters</i>, page 47.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_286">286</a>. "Navium applicationibus" (cf. <i>Domesday</i>, 32:
"De exitu aquæ ubi naves applicabant") is a phrase occurring
elsewhere as "appulatione navium." It there equates "theloneum,"
and was doubtless a payment for landing-dues. So,
"de teloneo dando ad Bilingesgate" is found in the Instituta
Londoniæ of Æthelred.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_312">312</a>, note 1. Compare the charge against Harold (in
the French life of the Confessor) that he "deners cum usurer
amasse."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_314">314</a>. The occurrence of "salinis" among the general
words in this charter is clearly due to the rights of the Beauchamps
in Droitwich and its salt-pans.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_371">371</a>. The amount of the <i>firma</i> seems to be determined
by an entry in the Pipe-Roll of 15 Hen. II. (page 169), which
makes it £500 "blanch," <i>plus</i> a varying sum of about £20
"numero."</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_372">372</a>. Henry's jealousy of the Londoners might also be
due, in part, to their steadfast support of Stephen and opposition
to his mother. His restriction of clauses (1) and (10) to lands
within the walls is illustrated by a citizen having to pay, in
1169 (<i>Rot. Pip.</i> 15 Hen. II., p. 173), "ut placitet contra W. de
R. <i>in civitate Lund'</i> de terra de Eggeswera" (Edgware), as a
special favour.</p>
